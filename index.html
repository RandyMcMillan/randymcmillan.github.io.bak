<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">What Blockstream Green is for</a><a class="headerlink" href="#what-blockstream-green-is-for" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Blockstream Green is a Bitcoin wallet - it’s a way for you to securely receive, store, and
send Bitcoin.</p>
<p>You can use Blockstream Green to accept incoming payments, keep your coins safe for long
periods of time, and to make payments and send Bitcoin to others.</p>
<p>Our wallet allows for convenient, instant access to your coins from a variety of platforms
through mutually compatible applications.</p>
<p>We offer a variety of advanced features, such as letting our users set their own spending
limits, watch-only access for observers, and our unique multisig security model. All of
these (and more) are explained in more detail below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-blockstream-green-isnt-for">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">What Blockstream Green isn’t for</a><a class="headerlink" href="#what-blockstream-green-isnt-for" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>It is just as important to understand what Blockstream Green isn’t for.</p>
<p>Blockstream Green is not a platform for buying and selling bitcoin. If you wish to buy or
sell bitcoin, you will need to use another method. After you have bought some Bitcoin, you
can send it to your Blockstream Green wallet and receive it by using the wallet’s receive
function.</p>
<p>Blockstream Green only supports Bitcoin (which is denoted by the 3-letter ticker <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BTC</span></code>).
We do not support any national currencies like USD or EUR. We do not support any other
cryptocurrencies, such as Peercoin or Dogecoin. Attempting to send anything other than
Bitcoin to an address generated by a Blockstream Green wallet can result in those coins
being permanently lost. This is completely out of our control, and we are unable to
provide support in this scenario. Before you send any coins to or from your Blockstream
Green wallet, be sure that both the sender and receiver are using the cryptocurrency
denoted by the ticker <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BTC</span></code>.</p>
<p>Always be sure to check the 3-letter currency ticker before sending any coins, and only

<p>Bitcoin has an alternative network known as ‘testnet’. This testnet network is just like
the real Bitcoin network (which is known as ‘mainnet’), but with worthless coins, so that
people can test features and applications without the risk of losing real coins.</p>
<p>Our wallets can connect to testnet by selecting testnet from the list of networks in the
settings of the login page. If you are new to Bitcoin or Blockstream Green, we urge you to
try things out on testnet first, so that you can get comfortable with how things work
before you start using your real coins.</p>
<p>Wallets, addresses, and coins on the Bitcoin Testnet are completely separate from the real
Bitcoin network. As such, you will need to create and secure a new mainnet wallet after
you are finished with testing and wish to use the real Bitcoin network. Trying to use an
address, or login credentials, or mnemonic from a testnet wallet or service on the Bitcoin
mainnet will not work.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is an exciting new technology with many advantages, but it comes with some extra
responsibilities on the users’ end. As a Bitcoin wallet provider, we at Blockstream Green
do not actually grant access to your Bitcoin - you do.</p>
<p>We are a non-custodial wallet. We provide you with the tools to manage your coins. Even if
we disappear, you still retain access to your Bitcoin. This is contrasted with a custodial
service, which holds coins on behalf of its users.</p>
<p>In a custodial system, the service is solely responsible for securing users coins.
Examples include a bank or cryptocurrency exchange that has a verification process for new
users, and then receives, stores, and sends coins on their users’ behalf, as long as they
can verify their identity. This kind of service can deny users access or confiscate their
coins at their own discretion or as a result of pressure from authorities.</p>
<p>This is not possible with Blockstream Green, as we are a non-custodial service. Each user
exclusively controls their own Bitcoin, and it’s not possible for Blockstream Green to
unilaterally move your coins. As long as you follow the instructions provided, you remain
in complete control of your coins, and are solely responsible for retaining access to
them.</p>
<p>Because of this, there are some differences between our services and user responsibilities
and more traditional financial tools and services. Be sure to read the Setting Up a Wallet
section for details; pay close attention to the recommended practices outlined there.</p>

<p>Blockstream Green is a completely free service - we do not earn any revenue from our
users, we neither collect, nor use any of their data.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that all Bitcoin transactions require a fee that is built in
as part of the Bitcoin protocol. This fee is paid to the miners who run expensive
equipment to secure the Bitcoin network and confirm users’ transactions.</p>
<p>There is no benefit to Blockstream Green for our users to pay high fees, and we do our
best to provide our users with tools and strategies to keep their fees low. At certain
times, however, factors beyond our control can lead to high fees when sending Bitcoin.</p>
<p>We do not ever receive these fees, and so have no way to return any fees to users after a
transaction has been confirmed. We always show the fee that a transaction will pay so you
can verify or change it before you make your transaction.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">What’s Special About Blockstream Green</a><a class="headerlink" href="#whats-special-about-blockstream-green" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>For those that are already familiar with how Bitcoin wallets typically work, you may know
about some of the convenience, security, and privacy features that using Bitcoin offers.</p>
<p>Thanks to our unique multi-signature format, we’re able to offer all the usual privacy and
freedom of typical Bitcoin wallets, but with extra security.</p>
<p>We use a format that requires signatures generated by 2 different keys, one of which is
controlled by you, and one of which is controlled by our service. The service will sign
transactions as long as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) confirmation – a one time password
delivered to you ideally on a separate device via Google Authenticator, email, SMS or call
– is given. This means that even if someone gets a hold of your mnemonic, they still can’t
steal your coins when you have 2FA enabled, unless they also compromise your 2FA method.</p>
<p>The process also stays trust minimized - even if, for some reason, the service cannot sign
your transaction, you can independently move your coins without the service after a chosen
period of time has passed.</p>
<p>This gets you the best of both worlds - the full financial sovereignty and trustlessness
of a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet along with the extra layer of server-enforced two factor
security.</p>
<p>Our design enables a lot of cool features, many of which are not available in other
wallets:</p>
<p><strong>Convenience</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Easy access from anywhere</p></li>

<p>At this point, the app will generate a 24-word mnemonic to function as a backup login
method for your wallet. (Our wallets use <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">the BIP39 standard</a> for generating your
mnemonic and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">BIP32</a> to derive private keys from that mnemonic).</p>

<p><strong>Your mnemonic is the single most important piece of information associated with your

<p><strong>You must write it down somewhere safe and secret - it’s your ultimate backup.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>It must be kept safe and accessible because if your app gets uninstalled, or your device
gets lost or stolen, or you forget your PIN, or your PIN gets reset, then your mnemonic
will let you access your coins again. Even if we at Blockstream Green get shut down or
disappear, you can still retain control of your coins as long as you have your mnemonic.</p>
<p>It must be kept secret because if someone else can figure out or steal your mnemonic, they
may be able to steal your coins (although if you have <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> set up,
they will need to bypass that as well…but we’ll cover that in the <a class="reference external" href="../troubleshooting-advanced/troubleshooting-advanced-index.html#two-factor-authentication">Two-Factor

<p>Using <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> is simple: whenever you take an action that requires

<p>Creating a wallet for the first time is a straightforward process, but there are a couple
of common mistakes that new Bitcoin users make.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>Not properly recording your mnemonic at the beginning might lead you to lose your
funds.</p>
</div>
<p>Though it might be inconvenient at the time, and you might be excited to use the wallet
immediately, it is very important to take the time to properly record your mnemonic and
safely store it.</p>
<p>Some other wallets allow users to start transacting without recording their mnemonic.
While this might seem OK, we believe that this is risky and irresponsible.</p>
<p>It is very easy for users to start accepting and sending bitcoins and delay properly
recording their mnemonic. Then, when something goes wrong in the future (their phone
breaks, the PIN is entered incorrectly, etc), they suddenly lose access to their their
coins.</p>
<p>Take extra-care to safely note and store your 24-words mnemonic. Please take this process
very seriously, and give it the time and attention that it needs.</p>
<p>—</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>Using a throw-away email address for your <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> can also result
in loss of coins!</p>
</div>
<p>Unless you immediately create more permanent alternative <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em>
methods (which we recommend anyway), or ensure you retain access to this throw-away email
address losing access to your email can be very inconvenient.</p>
<p>Make sure you use an email address that you will be able to access in the future.</p>
<p>—</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>Creating a new wallet while there is an existing wallet on the app could prevent you
from being able to access this new wallet, unless you safely store this new wallet
mnemonic.</p>
</div>
<p>You will be allowed to create as many wallets as you like on your Blockstream Green app,
but it can only store one PIN-protected mnemonic at a time. This means that any new
wallets won’t be PIN-accessible on that device, and in the future must be logged into
using the full mnemonic.</p>
<p>If you wish to create a new wallet, and have your app store a PIN for the new one, you
will need to first disable the PIN on the original wallet. You can do this by entering an
incorrect PIN 3 times in a row, or from settings after you have logged in.</p>

<p>You can also view from this screen all of your wallet’s incoming and outgoing
transactions. Transactions are listed in reverse chronological order, starting with the
most recent transactions at the top.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to see the date, time, amount (in Bitcoin and fiat currency), and
confirmation status of any transactions. You can also select any transaction to get more
information about it, such as its Transaction Hash, which can be used as a
proof-of-payment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="receiving-transactions">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Receiving Transactions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#receiving-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To receive Bitcoin, all you need to do is provide a receiving address to the sender.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/receive.png"><img alt="_images/receive.png" class="align-center" src="_images/receive.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>A Bitcoin receiving address is a string of numbers and letters. You can create a receiving
address by selecting “Receive” from the main screen. Your wallet will generate a new
receiving address each time you prompt it for one. While it is possible to reuse old
addresses, we strongly advise against this because it lessens your privacy.</p>
<p>Once you can see what your new address is, you’ll need to communicate it to the sender.
If you need to send over a distance, a text message or email is an effective way to do it.</p>
<p>If you are physically beside the person who will be sending you Bitcoin, another option is
to use the QR code, which the sender can scan to get the receiving address. This is really
convenient if the sender is using a mobile wallet.</p>
<p>Once someone has sent a transaction to your Blockstream Green wallet, it should appear in
your transaction list page. At first, it will be labelled “unconfirmed”. At this point,
you should not consider the coins to have been received, because the transaction may still
get overwritten or canceled. The transaction will over time accumulate “confirmations” as
new blocks are mined in the Bitcoin network. Once your transaction reaches 6
confirmations, your wallet will list it as “confirmed” and you can consider the coins
received.</p>

<div class="section" id="sending-transactions">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Sending Transactions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#sending-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To send a transaction, select “Send” from the main screen.</p>
<p>You will need to get the receiving address from the recipient, and enter it (either by
typing or pasting it in, or by scanning the receiver’s QR code).</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/send-receipient.png"><img alt="_images/send-receipient.png" class="align-center" src="_images/send-receipient.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>

<p>After you have sent a transaction, you need to wait for the network to confirm it, which
can take a bit of time. You can check the status of a transaction by looking into your
transaction history on the main screen.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-happens-after-a-transaction-is-sent">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">What Happens After a Transaction Is Sent</a><a class="headerlink" href="#what-happens-after-a-transaction-is-sent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Many new users sometimes wonder why they need to wait for Bitcoin transactions to
complete. Why don’t they happen instantly?</p>
<p>This is because after the transaction has been sent, the sender and receiver’s jobs are
done, but there are still several steps that need to be completed behind the scenes.</p>
<p>To become confirmed, a transaction needs to be included in a block. Blocks are created
every 10 minutes on average, but this is only an average, and can vary from time to time.
Sometimes blocks are found much more quickly (several within a minute) or much slower
(can take over an hour).</p>
<p>Depending on how busy the network is, and how high a fee the sender paid, the transaction
may not be included in the next block.</p>
<p>Once the transaction has been included in a block, it has 1 “confirmation”. Every block
mined after that earns it another confirmation. The industry standard is to wait for 6
confirmations before considering a transaction to be confirmed, at which point you can be
confident that it has been received and can not be reversed or redirected. You will be
able to see the confirmations accumulate on your wallet’s default screen.</p>

<div class="section" id="our-multisignature-model">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Our Multisignature Model</a><a class="headerlink" href="#our-multisignature-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Blockstream Green wallets use a special transaction format different from most other
Bitcoin wallets.</p>
<p>Most other storage services in Bitcoin are either “custodial” or “non-custodial without
<em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> security”.</p>
<p>Custodial services, such as exchanges, hold your Bitcoin for you. This also means that
they can confiscate your coins at will, or if they get hacked, your coins can get stolen.
It also usually means KYC identification, and risks of privacy loss.</p>
<p>Other non-custodial wallets do not have those issues, but it also means that if someone
steals your mnemonic or gain access to your wallet, they can steal all of your coins.
The secrecy of your mnemonic is the only thing protecting your coins with these wallets.</p>
<p>With Blockstream Green, you get the benefits of both types.</p>
<p>This is possible because coins in Blockstream Green wallets have two different spend
conditions.</p>
<p>The first way to spend coins is using signatures from 2 different keys to send coins. One
is held by the user in the form of the mnemonic, which the service  never knows. The other
is stored on our server, and we sign your transactions with it after any <em>Two-Factor
Authentication</em> you have enabled verifies the transaction.</p>
<p>This means that, unlike custodial solutions, we can never steal your coins, since we don’t
know your mnemonic. Even if we get hacked, or taken over by a government entity, or
something else catastrophic happens, no one can steal your coins.</p>
<p>On the user side, even if someone steals your mnemonic, they cannot spend your coins
unless they can access your <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em>. This is the type of security that
other wallets do not offer.</p>
<p>The second way to spend coins becomes available after your two factor recovery period
expires. Once this happens,  you can spend your coins without our service needing to also
sign. This is to ensure that no matter what happens, you can always get your coins back.</p>
<p>Our signature scheme also allows us to enforce <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> security, <em>Two-
Factor Authentication</em> spending thresholds, and other extra options. These features do not
exist in typical Bitcoin wallets.</p>

<div class="section" id="redeposits">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id22">Redeposits</a><a class="headerlink" href="#redeposits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As explained above, coins in your main Blockstream Green wallet (or a 2of2 simple account)
require 2 signatures to be spent: one from you and one from Blockstream Green. In order to
protect you from loss of access to your coins should Blockstream Green become unavailable,
there is an alternative spend condition which requires only the user’s signature, provided
that a certain period of time has passed.</p>
<p>If the service becomes unavailable, you simply wait for the specified period (90 days by
default), then sign and send the transaction using our open source recovery tool
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/greenaddress/garecovery">garecovery</a>.</p>
<p>After the expiry period passes, any other limits placed on your spending in Blockstream
Green, such as <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> requirements, cease to be enforceable by the
service.</p>
<p>At this point the wallet will prompt you to redeposit the coins by sending them to
yourself (If you don’t log in to the wallet during this time, and you have email
notifications enabled, the service will email you a reminder as the expiry date gets
closer). The creation of the redeposit transaction resets the expiry period, thereby
re-protecting the coins by once again requiring a Blockstream Green signature to spend
them.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this redeposit transaction is a regular Bitcoin transaction, and as such
is subject to the usual transaction fees for the miners.</p>
<p>You can also adjust the expiry period in your settings if you wish it to be longer or
shorter. A shorter expiry means you need to redeposit more often to maintain your <em>Two-
Factor Authentication</em> security but don’t have to wait as long to recover; a longer expiry
lets you redeposit less often, but you have to wait longer if your <em>Two-Factor
Authentication</em> becomes inaccessible.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="liquid-index.html#raw-assets">raw identifier of the asset and the customizable fields</a>

<p>Here you can see a series of metadata defined by the asset issuer:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>the official Name of the asset,</p></li>
<li><p>the Asset ID, a 64 hexadecimal characters long unique identifier of the asset, used
on the network to identify the asset,</p></li>
<li><p>the Total Balance of the asset that you currently own in your wallet,</p></li>
<li><p>the decimal Precision, which defines how many satoshis of an asset should be
interpreted as a whole unit. A 2 decimals precision would imply that 199 satoshis of
an asset should be displayed as 1.99. Your wallet already displays all the amounts of
each asset using the precision specified under this field.</p></li>
<li><p>the Ticker is a 3 or 4 characters shortening of the asset name, used to denominate
all of the amounts of this asset with a recognizable abbreviation,</p></li>
<li><p>the Issuer domain, which is used to tie together all of the above information to the
issuing entity that also controls the domain submitted to the registry. This
information is critical for the user to visually validate that an asset with a
certain Name and a specific Ticker really belongs to the right issuer.</p></li>

<p>Issued Assets without a record on the Asset Registry will not have the same richness in
information as registered assets.</p>
<p>You can anyway see a very important piece of information, which is the Asset ID. This 64
hexadecimal characters long string is the unique identifier of any asset, and you should
always check with the asset issuer that you received an asset that matches their specified
Asset ID. The asset issuer should always publish the ID of any asset they issue, otherwise
anyone could cheaply create a bogus asset and defraud you by sending a worthless asset.</p>

<p>To receive Liquid Bitcoin or any other Issued Asset, all you need to do is provide a
receiving address to the sender.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/receive-liquid.png"><img alt="_images/receive-liquid.png" class="align-center" src="_images/receive-liquid.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>A Liquid receiving address is a string of numbers and letters. You can create a receiving
address by selecting “Receive” from the main screen.</p>
<p>All addresses in Liquid are, by default, blinded using
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#to-confidential-transactions"><span class="std std-ref">Confidential Transactions</span></a>. Blinding is the process
by which the amount and type of asset being transferred is cryptographically hidden from
everyone except the sending and receiving parties.</p>
<p>Your wallet will generate a new receiving address each time you prompt it for one. While
it is possible to reuse old addresses, we strongly advise against this because it lessens
your privacy.</p>
<p>Once you can see what your new address is, you’ll need to communicate it to the sender.
If you need to send over a distance, a text message or email is an effective way to do it.</p>
<p>If you are physically beside the person who will be sending you Bitcoin, another option is
to use the QR code, which the sender can scan to get the receiving address. This is really
convenient if the sender is using a mobile wallet.</p>
<p>Once someone has sent a transaction to your Blockstream Green wallet, it should appear in
your transaction list page. At first, it will be labelled “unconfirmed”.</p>
<p>Transactions on Liquid are <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#to-blocksigner"><span class="std std-ref">settled with finality after 2 blocks</span></a>,
therefore you can consider your funds to be finally received within 2 or 3 minutes,
under normal network conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sending-transactions">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Sending Transactions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#sending-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To send a transaction, select “Send” from the main screen.</p>
<p>You will need to get the receiving address from the recipient, and enter it (either by
typing or pasting it in, or by scanning the receiver’s QR code).</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/send-recipient-liquid.png"><img alt="_images/send-recipient-liquid.png" class="align-center" src="_images/send-recipient-liquid.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/send-amount-liquid.png"><img alt="_images/send-amount-liquid.png" class="align-center" src="_images/send-amount-liquid.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>Your wallet will also automatically calculate a fee for your transaction, which is
necessary to have the network accept it and to avoid Denial of Service.</p>
<p>Finally you can review your transaction and send it after confirming your Two-Factor
Authentication.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/send-review-liquid.png"><img alt="_images/send-review-liquid.png" class="align-center" src="_images/send-review-liquid.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>After you have sent a transaction, it will be <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#to-blocksigner"><span class="std std-ref">settled with finality after 2 blocks</span></a>, therefore your counterparty will receive the funds within 2 or 3
minutes, under normal network conditions.</p>

<div class="section" id="our-multisignature-model">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Our Multisignature Model</a><a class="headerlink" href="#our-multisignature-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Blockstream Green wallets use a special transaction format different from most other
Bitcoin wallets.</p>
<p>Most other storage services in Bitcoin are either “custodial” or “non-custodial without
<em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> security”.</p>
<p>Custodial services, such as exchanges, hold your Bitcoin for you. This also means that
they can confiscate your coins at will, or if they get hacked, your coins can get stolen.
It also usually means KYC identification, and risks of privacy loss.</p>
<p>Other non-custodial wallets do not have those issues, but it also means that if someone
steals your mnemonic or gain access to your wallet, they can steal all of your coins.
The secrecy of your mnemonic is the only thing protecting your coins with these wallets.</p>
<p>With Blockstream Green, you get the benefits of both types.</p>
<p>This is possible because coins in Blockstream Green wallets have two different spending
conditions.</p>
<p>The first way to spend coins is using signatures from 2 different keys to send coins. One
is held by the user in the form of the mnemonic, which the service  never knows. The other
is stored on our server, and we sign your transactions with it after any <em>Two-Factor
Authentication</em> you have enabled verifies the transaction.</p>
<p>This means that, unlike custodial solutions, we can never steal your coins, since we don’t
know your mnemonic. Even if we get hacked, or taken over by a government entity, or
something else catastrophic happens, no one can steal your coins.</p>
<p>On the user side, even if someone steals your mnemonic, they cannot spend your coins
unless they can access your <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em>. This is the type of security that
other wallets do not offer.</p>
<p>The second way to spend coins becomes available after your two factor recovery period
expires. Once this happens,  you can spend your coins without our service needing to also
sign. This is to ensure that no matter what happens, you can always get your coins back</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="redeposits">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Redeposits</a><a class="headerlink" href="#redeposits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As explained above, coins in your main Blockstream Green wallet (or a 2of2 simple account)
require 2 signatures to be spent: one from you and one from Blockstream Green. In order to
protect you from loss of access to your coins should Blockstream Green become unavailable,
there is an alternative spend condition which requires only the user’s signature, provided
that a certain period of time has passed.</p>
<p>If the service becomes unavailable, you simply wait for the specified period (65535 blocks
on Liquid, circa 45 days days, by default), then sign and send the transaction using our
open source recovery <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/greenaddress/garecovery">garecovery</a>.</p>
<p>After the expiry period passes, any limits placed on your spending in Blockstream Green,
such as <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> requirements, cease to be enforceable by the service.</p>
<p>At this point the wallet will prompt you to redeposit the coins by sending them to
yourself (If you don’t log in to the wallet during this time, and you have email
notifications enabled, the service will email you a reminder as the expiry date gets
closer). The confirmation of the redeposit transaction resets the expiry period, thereby
re-protecting the coins by once again requiring a Blockstream Green signature to spend
them.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this redeposit transaction is a regular Liquid transaction, and as such
is subject to the usual network fees.</p>

<p>Blockstream Green multisig wallets can be used with hardware wallets. This gives you the
best of both worlds by combining Blockstream Green’s multisig security with the private
key cold storage provided by a hardware wallet.</p>
<p>A Blockstream Green wallet associated with a hardware wallet creates a 2-of-2 multisig
wallet where one key is held on your hardware wallet, and the second key is held by the
Blockstream Green service. The second key serves to authorize transactions through
Two-Factor Authentication.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: To use a hardware wallet with Blocsktream Green, first initialize the hardware
device according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Safely record and store the hardware device’s mnemonic and PIN that were
created in the previous step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Connect your hardware wallet to Green.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For USB hardware wallets: Plug in the hardware wallet into the Android device that has a
Blockstream Green wallet installed and open Blockstream Green.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The Blockstream Green app can be opened before or after plugging in the hardware device.</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For Bluetooth hardware wallets: Turn your hardware wallet on, open Green and tap on
<strong>Connect hardware wallet</strong> via the top right menu on the login page (see below), then

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/connect-hww.jpg"><img alt="_images/connect-hww.jpg" class="align-center" src="_images/connect-hww.jpg" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Enter the hardware wallet’s PIN.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For Trezor One, enter the PIN through the smartphone with the hardware wallet’s onscreen
keyboard guide.</p></li>
<li><p>For Ledger Nano S, enter the PIN and open the Bitcoin application to login.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations, you are now logged into your 2-of-2 Blockstream Green wallet.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you didn’t have an existing Blockstream Green wallet associated with this hardware
wallet device, a new 2-of-2 wallet will be created. If you had already logged into a
Blockstream Green wallet with your hardware wallet, you will be automatically logged
back into it.</p>

<p>Log into your Blockstream Green wallet by completing the setup and login instructions in
the preceding section.</p>
<p>When sending transactions, the hardware wallet will ask to confirm the transactions.</p>
<p>After confirming transactions with the hardware wallet, a Two-Factor Authentication code

<p>In the event that a hardware wallet used to log into a Blockstream Green wallet is lost or
broken, there are two options for restoring the Blockstream Green wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong>: Restore the Blockstream Green wallet on a new hardware wallet using the
backup mnemonic (“recovery seed”, “recovery phrase”) created when the old hardware wallet
was setup. Follow the hardware wallet manufacturer’s instructions to restore the backup
mnemonic. Then run Blockstream Green starting with <strong>Step 3</strong> from the preceding
<strong>New Wallet Setup and Login</strong> section.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2</strong>: Restore the Blockstream Green wallet by entering the backup mnemonic created
when the old hardware device was setup via the <strong>Restore Green Wallet</strong> button on the

<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>If you have lost or forgotten your PIN, you will need to use your mnemonic to
log in. We cannot tell our users their PIN because we do not store it on our database.</p>
</div>
<p>Keep in mind that each PIN is specific to the app installed on a particular device, and is
not universal across multiple apps that access the same wallet. The PIN that you use to
access your wallet from your iPhone is not necessarily the same as the PIN that you use to
access your wallet from your Desktop.</p>
<p>If the PIN is incorrectly entered three times in a row, the app will assume that a
malicious party is trying to gain access to the device, and will no longer accept attempts
to access by PIN. In this scenario, one must use their mnemonic to access their wallet on
that device.</p>

<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>If your app no longer accepts your PIN, first check to see if the network
selected in the middle of the landing page page is the correct one, i.e. you should
see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bitcoin</span></code> if you created the wallet and PIN on Bitcoin mainnet, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Liquid</span></code> if
it was a Liquid wallet. Select the correct network to have the app accept your PIN.</p>
</div>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/landing2.png"><img alt="_images/landing2.png" class="align-center" src="_images/landing2.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>If the PIN login option is not available, then it means that your PIN has been reset, and
you will need to use your mnemonic to log in.</p>
<p>This can happen for a variety of reasons including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>someone entering a PIN incorrectly 3 times in a row</p></li>
<li><p>changes to the base operating system by mobile carriers/mod authors that introduce bugs
or incompatibilities in the native PIN API</p></li>
<li><p>bugs in the phone’s firmware (or networking stack after entering the PIN incorrectly
only once)</p></li>
<li><p>damage to the phone’s filesystem from physical shocks such as being dropped or getting
wet</p></li>
<li><p>settings being overwritten by malware</p></li>
<li><p>incorrect or incomplete OTA system upgrades or app updates</p></li>
<li><p>unexpected phone power loss</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The remedy is the same regardless of the cause: you must use your mnemonic to log in again
.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trouble-entering-mnemonic">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Trouble Entering Mnemonic</a><a class="headerlink" href="#trouble-entering-mnemonic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When entering your mnemonic, enter the words all in lowercase. After you have typed all 24
words, you can press the submit button.</p>
<p>If you are trying to enter your mnemonic and it is not working, then one of three error
messages should appear.</p>
<div class="section" id="invalid-words">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Invalid Words</a><a class="headerlink" href="#invalid-words" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The first possibility is that one or more words are not valid under the mnemonic scheme
that we use. Typically, the words are just misspelled, and they are highlighted in red or
strikethrough.</p>
<p>Correcting or changing the erroneous word(s) may make your mnemonic correct again.</p>
<p>You can also find the list of valid words at:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt">BIP39</a></p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>You may wish to try with similar looking words if one of your words is not
written down clearly.</p>
</div>
<p>If you are missing a word or they are in the wrong order, then you will need to attempt to
recover them using a wallet recovery service or tool, but this is beyond the scope of
support that we can provide.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you are using the latest version of the wallet and that you are using
lower case (small letters) and no commas or other whitespace such as tab, leading or
trailing whitespace.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>If you are copy and pasting your mnemonic into the text box, please try typing
them as sometimes they may have been saved in an incorrect encoding.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="out-of-order-mnemonic-words">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Out of Order Mnemonic Words</a><a class="headerlink" href="#out-of-order-mnemonic-words" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The second possibility is that the words that you have entered are valid words in the
mnemonic scheme, but that one of the words is incorrect (though still a valid word) or
they are in the wrong order. One or more of the words are incorrect, but the app doesn’t
know which one since they are all potentially valid words.</p>
<p>As with the previous error, you may wish to try and investigate which word(s) may have
been recorded incorrectly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="not-a-blockstream-green-wallet-greenaddress-mnemonic">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Not a Blockstream Green Wallet (GreenAddress) Mnemonic</a><a class="headerlink" href="#not-a-blockstream-green-wallet-greenaddress-mnemonic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The third possible error is that the mnemonic is valid, but it doesn’t match anything in
our database. There are several possible causes for this.</p>
<p>It can happen if someone tries to enter a mnemonic from their Blockstream Green testnet
wallet. The testnet and mainnet versions of the wallet are completely separate and
function on different networks.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the mnemonic entered corresponds to a valid private key that
was generated by a Blockstream Green wallet, but that the wallet has since been deleted
by its owner.</p>
<p>Lastly, an error message will appear if someone is trying to restore a wallet that was
created by a separate service. Because Blockstream Green wallets use a special 2of2
multisig address type, mnemonics generated by other services aren’t compatible with our
system. (If you wish to move all coins from an existing non-Blockstream Green wallet into
a Blockstream Green wallet, then you can send them in a transaction, or use the sweep
function.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lost-or-incorrect-mnemonic">

<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>If for some reason you have lost your mnemonic, or you suspect that your record
of your mnemonic has been damaged or tampered with, and if you are still able to log
into your wallet with a PIN, then you can view your mnemonic from the settings page to
double-check or re-record them.</p>
</div>
<p>If, however, your wallet no longer accepts your PIN, which can happen for a variety of
reasons, and you have lost your mnemonic, we are unable to assist you in accessing your
wallet. In this situation, your coins may be permanently lost, unless you can recover your
mnemonic.</p>
<p>In the Bitcoin world, it is unfortunately common for users to erroneously record their
24-word mnemonic. One way to avoid this is to double-check that you have correctly
recorded by installing a fresh version of our app on a different device and then testing
it there to see if it works.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lost-device-or-accidental-uninstallation">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Lost Device or Accidental Uninstallation</a><a class="headerlink" href="#lost-device-or-accidental-uninstallation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If the only device you use to access your Blockstream Green wallet is lost or stolen, or
for some reason the program gets uninstalled or deleted, you will need to install a fresh
version of the app on some device, and use your mnemonic to restore your wallet.</p>
<p>Once the app is installed, do not choose the option create a new wallet. Instead, you can
restore your existing wallet by entering its mnemonic that you have already recorded.</p>
<p>After this, the app will ask you to create a PIN for that device. It can be the same as
the old one, or you can choose a new one.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>This procedure can also be used if you simply wish to be able to access a single
wallet from multiple devices.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Watch-Only Mode</a><a class="headerlink" href="#watch-only-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Watch-only mode is a feature that allows the owner of a wallet to create an alternative
login method that can view the activity on a wallet without being able to change any
crucial settings or send coins.</p>
<p>This can be useful for situations if you want to let someone else access your wallet to
get a receiving address or confirm for you that coins have been received.</p>
<p>You can add a watch-only login under the “Network” section of settings. Select “Watch-Only
Login”, and then you can create the new username and password, and press save.</p>
<p>You can return and edit this anytime you are logged in as the wallet’s owner.</p>
<p>To log in with the watch-only login, you need to return to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Onboarding</span></code> screen by
logging out of the main wallet. Then, instead of entering your PIN or mnemonic, tap or
click on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eye</span> <span class="pre">icon</span></code> on the top right corner of the home screen.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/landing2.png"><img alt="_images/landing2.png" class="align-center" src="_images/landing2.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>This will prompt you to enter the username and password that you chose in settings, and
will grant access to a limited version of the wallet only for viewing transaction history,
receiving transactions, or sweeping a paper wallet or WIF private key.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>You can safely give this username and password out to anyone else who you want to
be able to view your wallet’s activity, without having to trust them not to steal -
they will be unable to ever send coins out of your wallet using this login information.</p>

<p>Under Settings-&gt;Network, you can find an option that allows you to disable your PIN to log
in.</p>
<p>If you choose to disable the PIN login you will need to enter your full 24-word mnemonic
every time you wish to access your wallet on that device. This can be useful for a
situation where you suspect someone may have access to your device and may be able to
guess your PIN.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Best Two-Factor Authentication Practices</a><a class="headerlink" href="#best-two-factor-authentication-practices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Properly managing your Two-Factor Authentication is one of the most important parts of
using your Blockstream Green wallet, so we strongly recommend that you follow all the
guidelines outlined here.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>Two-Factor authentication is the security method you use to authorize our
server to provide the second signature for transactions. This means that in order for
someone to steal coins from your wallet, they would need to steal your private key (by
learning your mnemonic, or logging into your device with your PIN), and gain access to
at least one of your Two-Factor authentication methods.</p>
</div>
<p>This is how Blockstream Green offers a higher level of security over other single-
signature wallets, which are compromised the moment someone else learns their mnemonic.</p>
<p>This means, however, that if you lose access to your Two-Factor authentication methods,
your coins can get stuck for long periods of time (~90 days by default).</p>
<p>For best practices, we strongly urge our users to:</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Set up your Two-Factor authentication methods as soon as you set up your wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Only use a permanent email or phone number that you will retain access to
indefinitely.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up at least two different Two-Factor authentication methods. This allows you to
retain access even if one of your methods fails.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Many of the most common problems that users of Blockstream Green face can be avoided by
following those basic practices.</p>

<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p>In general, it is a good idea to keep more than one Two-Factor authentication
method activated, but this is especially important if SMS is one of your methods.</p>
</div>
<p>This is because it is prone to more problems than other methods due to potential issues on
the end of the phone carrier, connectivity issues in certain regions, and other issues,
making it the least reliable Two-Factor authentication method.</p>
<p>From time to time, users suddenly lose access to their SMS Two-Factor authentication
method for a variety of reasons beyond our control (SMS routing issues, service provider
changes, etc), but there are several things you can do to reduce the chances of this
happening:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For obvious reasons, never use a temporary phone number.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, only set up your SMS Two-Factor authentication method from the location that you
plan on usually using it from. It has happened that users have activated their SMS Two-
Factor authentication while traveling, only to find that routing issues prevent them
from using it when they return home.</p></li>

<div class="admonition note">

<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Google Authenticator</a><a class="headerlink" href="#google-authenticator" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The final available Two-Factor authentication method is using Google Authenticator.</p>
<p>To set up this method, you will first need to download the authenticator app on Android or
iOS.</p>
<p>Toggle the Google Authenticator option under settings-&gt;Two-Factor authentication to
activate it.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you have any other Two-Factor authentication methods already activated, you
will first need to confirm with one of them that you wish to add a new Two-Factor
authentication method.</p>
</div>
<p>Then, you will be prompted with a QR code, which you can scan using your Google
Authenticator app. Alternatively, you can also manually enter the code.</p>
<p>Once this happens, every 30 seconds your authenticator app will automatically generate
6-digit codes that can be entered.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of using this as your Two-Factor authentication method is that
you do not need to wait for a message or a call in order to enter the code. Your app will
constantly generate them.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>If you lose your only device with your Google Authenticator app, you can get
permanently locked out of this method.</p>

authentication methods activated at all times.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Due to this risk, we also encourage users to backup the QR code and/or the
alphanumeric code that is shown in the wallet when you set it up.</p>
</div>
<p>This allows you to restore Google Authenticator Two-Factor authentication on another
device, using the Google Authenticator App, should you lose access to your first.</p>

<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>Two-Factor reset is an option of last resort for users that accidentally lose
access to <strong>all</strong> of their Two-Factor authentication methods.</p>
<p>It will require <strong>at least 1 year</strong> before being able to spend the funds with the new
Two-Factor authentication email.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>As long as you retain access to at least one other Two-Factor authentication
method, you will be able to <a class="reference internal" href="#disable-and-change">disable and change</a> the lost Two-Factor authentication
method, and recreate one under your control.</p>
<p>An alternative to re-gain control of your funds is to wait for the redeposit period to
expire and then use our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/greenaddress/garecovery">garecovery</a> tool to send your coins to another wallet.</p>
</div>
<p>This why we strongly recommend having at least two different methods enabled and
accessible at all times.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some users do not follow best practices and will lose their only Two-Factor
authentication (or in extreme circumstances, may be exceptionally unlucky and lose access
to multiple Two-Factor authentication methods at the same time).</p>
<p><strong>Resetting is advisable if, and only if, all of the following are applicable to you</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you lost access to all of your Two-Factor authentication methods;</p></li>
<li><p>If you do not feel confident in using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/greenaddress/garecovery">garecovery</a> tool;</p></li>
<li><p>If you do not possess the <a class="reference external" href="./troubleshooting-advanced-index.html#nlocktime">nLockTime.zip files</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Two-Factor reset feature, can be found in the “Settings” page, under the Two-Factor
section.</p>
<p>You start the reset process by entering an email address, which you must confirm.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Once you have done this the waiting period will begin. The <strong>waiting period
is at least 1 year long</strong> (see below), and a countdown in days will be displayed in
your wallet’s settings.</p>
</div>
<p>If the waiting period goes by without interruption by the wallet’s owner, then email
Two-Factor authentication will be enabled and set to the reset email address. Then you can
again use your wallet as normal, including setting up new Two-Factor authentication
methods.</p>
<p>The long waiting period is a crucial security measure, in case someone temporarily
accessed their wallet and tried to use the reset feature to steal their coins. The waiting
period gives the rightful owner of the wallet time to log in and access their wallet to
dispute the Two-Factor authentication reset.</p>
<p>The exact formula for the waiting period is whichever of these two is longer:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>365 days after the reset is triggered, OR</p></li>
<li><p>365 days plus your nLockTime period after the your wallet’s last transaction</p></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>For example:</dt><dd><p>i. you have your nLockTime period set to 30 days, and your last transaction was 40 days
ago, then the waiting period will be 365 days.</p>
<p>ii. you have your nLockTime period set to 90 days, and you sent a transaction 50 days,
ago, then the waiting period will be 405 days (365 days + 40 days left on your
nLocktime).</p>

<p>One of the many advantages of using Blockstream Green is that you get multi-platform
support - you can access your wallet from different devices on different operating systems
.</p>
<p>To do this, you need to first have a wallet created (on any one of our apps), and have the
mnemonic carefully recorded.</p>
<p>Now, install any version of our app on the secondary device that you wish to use. Once it
is installed, do not create a new wallet. Instead, tap on <cite>Restore Green Wallet</cite> and enter
your 24-word mnemonic from your original wallet.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/landing2.png"><img alt="_images/landing2.png" class="align-center" src="_images/landing2.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>After this, the app will ask you to create a PIN (if there is no other PIN-protected
mnemonic on your device).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It is important to understand that this is not the same PIN that you use to
enter your wallet in the original device. Each device can be set up with its own PIN.
The mnemonic is common to all devices accessing the same wallet and coins, but each PIN
is specific to the device it was created on.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you have done this, you can freely access your coins from either device, and make
changes as you please. Also, any coins sent or received on one device will be reflected in
all other devices connecting to that same wallet.</p>

<div class="admonition caution">

<p>Keep in mind, that managing multiple wallets on a single device will mean
carefully managing a separate 24-word mnemonic for each wallet. It is already
imperative that you keep any mnemonic safely and secretly recorded, but managing
multiple wallets will make very clear as to why!</p>

<span class="pre">Wallet</span></code> on the bottom of the <em>Onboarding</em> page.</p>
<p>When you do this, you will be warned that <strong>you can only have one PIN-protected mnemonic
at one time on a network</strong>. If you continue, your mnemonic is the only means you have to
recover your wallet as you will not be able to set a PIN.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/PIN-warning.png"><img alt="_images/PIN-warning.png" class="align-center" src="_images/PIN-warning.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>

screen every time.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to access this new wallet (B) via PIN, you first need to erase the existing

wallet’s transaction activity, directly below the send and receive buttons. This displays,
in order from newest to oldest, a history of all transactions that have entered and left
your wallet.</p>

<p>From the main page, you’ll be able to see the date of the transaction, the other recipient
or sender’s address, and the amount displayed in BTC.</p>
<p>You can also click on any one of the transactions to see extra detailed information about
it. The most common reason to do this is to get a Transaction ID or TXID. This is also
known as a Transaction Hash, and can be shown to other people as a proof-of-payment, since
it allows them to find and verify the transaction for themselves.</p>
<p>Aside from the TXID, there is much more useful information, especially for more advanced

<p>Funds in your main Green account (or a multisignature 2of2 subaccount) require 2
signatures to be spent: one from you and one from Green. In order to protect you from
loss of access to your funds should Green become unavailable, Green automatically creates
pre-signed transactions which you can subsequently countersign to recover the funds to an
address controlled solely by you. These transactions are called nLockTime transactions
because they can only be spent and confirmed by the network after a specific period of
time.</p>
<p>If the service becomes unavailable, you simply wait until the specified expiry period (90
days by default), then sign and send the transaction using our open source recovery tool

<p>There are pros and cons to making the expiry period longer or shorter. The longer it is,
the less frequently you need to do redeposits, which saves you fees. But this also means
that if you lose your 2FA, or if our servers become inaccessible, then you need to wait
longer to to unilaterally move your coins.</p>
<p>nLocktime is measured in blocks, which occur every 10 minutes on average, so our software

</dl>
<p>For example, let’s say that you have 200 mBTC in your wallet, and you want to make sure
that you don’t spend more than 35 mBTC before again .</p>
<p>You could go into your Two-Factor settings to “Two-Factor threshold”, press the it and set
it to 35 mBTC. This would allow you to spend up to a total of 35 mBTC without passing Two-
Factor authentication. Let’s say that you make 3 payments of 10 mBTC over the next week.
The fourth time you attempt to do this, the app will require you to pass 2FA (since you
will only have 5 mBTC left on your spending limit), which can act as a reminder that you
are getting close to your threshold.</p>
<p>You can always override or update the Two-Factor threshold from settings, but this will
require confirming using your 2FA if the threshold is higher than the existing one.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id31">Segregated Witness</a><a class="headerlink" href="#segregated-witness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Segregated Witness (aka SegWit) was a crucial upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol from 2017,
and enables cheaper transaction fees, among other benefits.</p>
<p>SegWit is turned on by default in Blockstream Green wallets, and we strongly recommend you
to leave it as such. If you are using an older version of our app that did not have it on
by default, you may wish to turn it on.</p>
<p>It will require no change in behavior from you as a user - you can send and receive
transactions as normal. The only difference you may notice would be slightly lower fees.</p>
<p>As a brief description of how it works - SegWit generates a special type of receiving
address that makes it cheaper to spend from.</p>
<p>Because this requires spending from SegWit addresses, if you have been using your wallet
without SegWit and then you turn it on, your existing bitcoins in your wallet will still
pay non-SegWit fees.</p>
<p>But whenever you spend any bitcoins that have been received in your from from after SegWit
has been enabled, they will benefit from lower fees.</p>

<p>Liquid is a sidechain-based, inter-exchange settlement network linking together cryptocurrency exchanges and institutions around the world, enabling faster Bitcoin transactions and the issuance of digital assets. Liquid is an implementation of <a class="reference external" href="https://elementsproject.org/">Elements</a>, an open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform, based on the Bitcoin codebase.</p>
<p>Liquid provides Bitcoin exchanges and traders with a range of powerful features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Fast, Final Settlements:</strong> Bitcoin moved to the Liquid sidechain (Liquid Bitcoin, “L-BTC”) can achieve final settlement within two minutes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Confidential Transactions:</strong> Amounts and type of asset transacted are hidden by default on Liquid, keeping users’ financial data safe.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Tokenization:</strong> New tokens can be issued on the Liquid sidechain (Issued Assets) to represent fiat, securities, or other digital assets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interoperability:</strong> One Liquid integration provides support for both L-BTC and Issued Assets. All tokens are based on the same standard, allowing users to take advantage of features such as atomic swaps and Bitcoin-style multisig.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Liquid is built using open-source <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements">Elements code</a>. This is why you download the application from the Elements
repository, execute commands against elementsd (daemon) and elements-cli (client), and edit things like the elements.conf config file.</p>
<p>As the Elements code defaults to using the live Liquid network, we’ll be referring to installing and running Liquid, and not Elements, throughout the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.blockstream.com">docs.blockstream.info</a> site.</p>
<div class="section" id="sidechain-basics">
<span id="to-sidechain-basics"></span><h3>Sidechain Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#sidechain-basics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Liquid is a sidechain of Bitcoin that allows users of the Liquid Network to move Bitcoin between the two networks with a two-way peg. Bitcoin used in the Liquid Network is referred to as L-BTC, and each L-BTC has a verifiably equivalent amount of BTC secured by the Liquid members called functionaries.</p>
<p>A <strong>sidechain</strong> is a mechanism that allows tokens from one blockchain to be used securely in an independent blockchain which runs in parallel and uses a different set of rules, performance requirements, and security mechanisms. On a sidechain, one can move tokens back to the original chain through a two-way peg. Sidechains enable new functionality that may have security trade-offs or as a way to test new features that may not be ready for use on the parent blockchain.</p>

<div class="section" id="network-roles">
<h3>Network Roles<a class="headerlink" href="#network-roles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Liquid Network is operated by its members - large exchanges and financial institutions that benefit from its use. Blockstream has no control of the network and serves only as a technology provider. With no single entity in control, there is no longer any single point of failure.</p>
<p>Liquid uses an approach to consensus called Strong Federations. A Strong Federation removes the need for costly Proof of Work mechanisms and replaces it with the collective actions of a group of mutually distrusting participants called functionaries.</p>
<div class="section" id="functionaries">
<span id="to-functionary"></span><h4>Functionaries<a class="headerlink" href="#functionaries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>These functionaries each serve two roles on the network - as <em>blocksigners</em> they operate the Liquid sidechain, and as <em>watchmen</em> they secure Bitcoins held by the Network.</p>
<div class="section" id="block-signer">
<span id="to-blocksigner"></span><h5>Block Signer<a class="headerlink" href="#block-signer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Liquid’s block generation occurs every minute. This means that Liquid’s block generation is more consistent than Bitcoin’s (which has probabilistic generation). Block signers keep track of the block height they have signed along with its parent and refuse to sign blocks that would result in a reorganization of more than one block. Once a block has been created, its parent block will never be reorganized from the longest chain, which is why Liquid transactions can be considered final once they receive two confirmations. Liquid transactions will settle between two and three minutes when the network is functioning normally.</p>
<p>Liquid’s federated model requires blocks to be signed by at least two-thirds of all block signers. Block signers take turns proposing a new block every minute in a round-robin fashion, and other functionaries sign that block after validating its contents. Blocks will be created every minute when the network is functioning normally. However, it is possible that network instability or missing functionaries can result in some block rounds being missed. When fewer than one-third functionaries are offline, the network can continue. When the offline functionary becomes the block proposer of a round, that round will fail, which will result in no block being created during that interval.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/blocksigner.png"><img alt="_images/blocksigner.png" src="_images/blocksigner.png" style="width: 85%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>If one-third or more of the functionaries are no longer operating, blocks will no longer be signed and the Liquid blockchain will be frozen until at least two-thirds of the functionaries come back online. Once a quorum of functionaries are communicating, block creation will resume.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="watchmen">
<span id="to-watchmen"></span><h5>Watchmen<a class="headerlink" href="#watchmen" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>One of the two duties of a functionary is to serve as a watchman. In this role, the functionary is responsible for managing and securing the Bitcoin held by the federation.</p>
<div class="section" id="peg-in-bitcoin-to-liquid">
<span id="to-pegin"></span><h6>Peg-in (Bitcoin to Liquid)<a class="headerlink" href="#peg-in-bitcoin-to-liquid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>Moving funds from Bitcoin to Liquid is called a peg-in; a member of Liquid sends Bitcoin to an address generated by the Liquid client software and then creates a peg-in transaction on the Liquid Network to claim its equivalent Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC) from the Liquid Network. A peg-in transaction requires 102 confirmations on the Bitcoin network before the funds can be claimed on the Liquid Network. This high level of security is required to protect all participants’ funds in the event of a large block reorganization of the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<h6>Peg-out (Liquid to Bitcoin)<a class="headerlink" href="#peg-out-liquid-to-bitcoin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The peg-out process moves funds from Liquid back to the Bitcoin blockchain. These transactions are processed by the watchmen in batches, where each peg-out round takes an expected time of ~17 minutes to complete.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The peg-out process is non-deterministic with an expected processing time of 11 to 35 minutes depending on the network conditions, such as watchman status when user peg-out was initiated and number of other peg-outs pending to process.</p>
</div>
<p>For added security, the watchmen will only send Bitcoin to an address under the control of an authorized user. This is done through the use of a Peg-out Authorization Key (PAK). Functionaries control a list a of PAKs that can be updated throughout the network operation to determine which users are authorized to make a peg-out transaction. In order to protect Liquid from unauthorized withdrawals, it takes three days to update the PAK list. This allows the network to detect an attacker that is able to compromise a set of functionaries before the attacker is able to make a withdrawal to their own wallet. PAK entries are linked to a BIP32 (Hierarchical Deterministic) Wallet owned by the user. Liquid users create a peg-out transaction proving that their address is derived from one of the PAK entries without revealing any additional identifying information.</p>

<div class="section" id="emergency-recovery-procedure">
<h6>Emergency Recovery Procedure<a class="headerlink" href="#emergency-recovery-procedure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The watchmen require a greater than two-thirds threshold to spend funds in Liquid which provides sufficient security for byzantine fault tolerance. If one-third or more of the network is ever unable to continue operating, the network would stall and the funds held would be locked up forever. To avoid this, all funds held by the Liquid Network are also accessible by a set of three emergency keys when the network has been non-functional for thirty consecutive days. These keys cannot be used to spend any funds when the network is operating correctly. Two of the three emergency keys can then be used to access funds held by the Liquid Network so that they can be distributed back to their owners’ authorized wallets. These keys are held in separate, secure locations to avoid a single point of failure.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hardware">
<h5>Hardware<a class="headerlink" href="#hardware" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The functionary server itself consists of two components - the host server and a key storage module. The host is a standard server that is used to run a full Bitcoin and Liquid node and communicates with the other functionaries over Tor. Tor is used by the functionaries to ensure that all communications between the functionaries do not contain IP addresses which could lead to members of the network being subject to denial of service attack, and to avoid disclosing the physical location of the servers. The host is responsible for proposing blocks and staying in sync with each of the other functionaries. Attached to each host is a key storage module that is connected via a limited interface. No block signing or watchman key material is ever stored on the host to limit the ability of a remote attacker compromising the network. The host is configured to only allow incoming SSH connections when a button is pressed which allows for authorized users to connect and perform updates to the software or PAK list. This protection means that physical access to the functionary server is required to perform any changes.</p>
<p>The key module does additional validation before signing blocks or creating Bitcoin transactions. The key module also ensures that Bitcoin spent from the network only is spent to a set of authorized users.</p>
<p>It is recommended to have physical access restricted to the functionary server in order to avoid tampering. The functionary server must be installed on a private network with unrestricted outgoing connections. Liquid wallets and transactions are managed through separate Liquid node software that will connect directly to your functionary.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="participants">
<span id="to-participant"></span><h4>Participants<a class="headerlink" href="#participants" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Liquid Network consists of a fixed group of functionary members that is defined at launch. Members without functionary hardware connect to the Liquid Network by using pseudo-functionary nodes that connect to all functionaries. Participant members can perform peg-ins, peg-outs, send Liquid transactions and fully validate the Liquid chain, without playing a role in securing the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="general-public">
<h4>General Public<a class="headerlink" href="#general-public" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Anyone can participate in the network by running a full node. These full nodes connect to the Liquid network via bridge nodes that are run by Functionaries and Participants members. Liquid full nodes allow users to trustlessly self-validate the chain just like with the Bitcoin Network and give its user free range ability to peg-in to the network, perform confidential transactions and make full use of the Issued Assets functionality.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>General public does not have the ability to independently peg-out of the network, which means they require from a Functionary or a Participant member to convert L-BTC back to BTC.</p>

<h3>Liquid Use Cases<a class="headerlink" href="#liquid-use-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="confidential-transactions">
<h4>Confidential Transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#confidential-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Liquid uses Confidential Transactions, which hides the amounts and asset types within transactions from all third parties. This information is only known by the parties involved in the transaction and other third parties they designate. Liquid transactions use confidential addresses that include a public blinding key and a base address. Only the receiver alone can decrypt the amount sent in a transaction. The receiver can share the private blinding key with any third party in order for that party to be able to validate the amount and asset type.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/confidential_transactions.png"><img alt="_images/confidential_transactions.png" src="_images/confidential_transactions.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Liquid transactions include a transaction fee that is used as a denial of service protection mechanism. Transaction fees are a minimum value of 1 satoshi/vbyte, but can rise if network congestion increases. Liquid transactions are larger than similar Bitcoin transactions due to “range proofs” that must be included in Confidential Transactions and are used to prove that no outputs are negative values.</p>
<p id="to-ct-limit">The implementation of Confidential Transactions in Liquid has important limitations regarding the amounts of transactions that will be protected: amounts are only completely hidden up to a certain maximum. The reason for this is that a larger maximum would require larger proofs leading to a larger overall transaction size and lower transaction throughput. The exact limit is 2^36 - 1 satoshis or about 687 BTC. Any transactions that try to exceed this limit will have to be split into seperate transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="issued-assets">
<span id="to-issued-assets"></span><h4>Issued Assets<a class="headerlink" href="#issued-assets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Liquid allows for users to create and transfer other assets using a feature called Issued Assets (IA). These assets can enable applications such as tokenized fiat, tokenized non-BTC cryptocurrency, digital collectibles, reward points and attested assets (e.g. gold coins). The obligations under an IA belong to the issuer and Liquid does not verify whether the underlying asset exists or is properly maintained (in contrast to the BTC peg-in procedures).</p>
<p>Issued Assets in Liquid are given a unique identifier (64 hexadecimal characters) when created. This is the only identifying information of the Issued Asset explicitly recorded on the Liquid blockchain. Any additional human readable metadata to ease Issued Assets recognition at the UI level, can be committed to during the issuance, and is published on servers such as the <a class="reference external" href="https://assets.blockstream.info/">Asset Registry</a>. The metadata that can be linked to an asset can be:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>an extended name, up to 255 characters (e.g. “IPA pint - liquid.beer”), to give a human readable name to the Issued Assets</p></li>
<li><p>a 3 or 4 characters ticker (e.g. “IPA”), used to denominate the amounts in a recognizable unit,</p></li>
<li><p>the decimal precision, mainly useful for issuers. For instance, 2 places of decimal precision would mean that 199 satoshi of the Issued Asset should be interpreted as 1.99 units of the asset,</p></li>
<li><p>a domain that must be controlled by the issuer (e.g. “liquid.beer”), which is used to tie together all of the above information to the entity that also controls the domain submitted to the registry.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Each asset type can optionally be configured to allow reissuance by generating reissuance tokens when it is created. Assets in Liquid can also be also be verifiably destroyed by their owner to reduce the supply.</p>
<p>The reissuance tokens are used to prove authority and reissue more of the newly created asset at a later date. These tokens can be set up with a multisignature scheme generally described as being “m of n”. That means that the reissuance transaction requires a group of “m”  keys in order to create new tokens.</p>
<p>Issued Assets can be used for many different purposes, but some of the most commonly requested ones include tokenized fiat, tokenized equities, and tokenized cryptocurrencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="security-tokens">
<h4>Security Tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#security-tokens" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Liquid’s Issued Assets feature allows for the creation of tokens representing tradable financial assets, often referred as securities. These securities can represent things like debt securities (bonds), equity securities ( stocks), or derivatives (futures, options, and swaps). The development of securities tokens on Liquid could involve the combination of smart contracts on chain or other off chain techniques. Issuers of security tokens on Liquid would benefit from Liquid’s security, reliability, privacy, and scalability.</p>

<h4>Stablecoins (Tokenized Fiat)<a class="headerlink" href="#stablecoins-tokenized-fiat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In this scenario, fiat currency is deposited in a bank account and held in trust of an issuer. The issuer generates tokens in Liquid representing the amount of money in that account and distributes the tokens to the depositors of the account. If the owner of one of these tokens wishes to receive fiat currency in return for it, he may redeem through the issuer. The issuer can then destroy the token and maintain an equal supply of fiat currency and outstanding tokens. As more fiat currency is deposited into the account, additional tokens can also be issued by the issuer. The issuer can prove to any auditor or regulator that the amount of outstanding tokens always matches the balance of the bank account. Issuers can also choose to use the scripting feature of Liquid to comply with different regulations around the world without adding any artificial requirements to the functionaries.</p>

<h4>Tokenized Cryptocurrencies<a class="headerlink" href="#tokenized-cryptocurrencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>While Liquid supports Bitcoin through its Federation, other cryptocurrencies are not natively supported. Very few cryptocurrencies have the track record for stability and security as Bitcoin and it would be risky to include them as part of the consensus rules of the system. Instead, Liquid members can create a token that represents a collateralized cryptocurrency. These tokens can now be traded and settled between Liquid users with the same speed and privacy as Bitcoin and other Issued Assets. This approach also allows exchanges and traders to safely handle these assets without ever needing to support the underlying asset. This removes the amount of work needed to support extra blockchains and clients when supporting other assets. Owners of these tokens could then take the issued token and redeem it from the issuer. This opt-in model allows for users who wish to benefit to work with parties they trust to issue and secure the assets without requiring the entire federation to know about the asset.</p>

<h4>Unique Tokens and Digital Collectables<a class="headerlink" href="#unique-tokens-and-digital-collectables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Liquid can be used to track unique items such as ordered prints by an artist or digital collectables like a set of CryptoLions. You can track unique assets using Issued Assets by issuing a single individual token for each individual asset. The issuer would then keep track of the asset ids that are created and provide a registry to help identify which asset is associated with which digital collectable. There is no way to natively categorize or group assets in Liquid, although wallet software could support this use case.</p>

<div class="section" id="allowing-rapid-transfer-of-funds">
<h4>Allowing Rapid Transfer of Funds<a class="headerlink" href="#allowing-rapid-transfer-of-funds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Using Liquid, exchanges may offer the ability for their users to quickly and privately deposit and withdraw funds. To do this, exchanges will hold a portion of funds on the Liquid Network. When a user wishes to deposit on an exchange, they will request a Liquid deposit address to be generated on their behalf by the exchange. The exchange will then generate a unique Liquid deposit address for this customer. The customer will then take this address to another exchange and request a Liquid withdrawal. The sending exchange will deduct the balance of the customer and send the funds through Liquid to the receiving exchange. When the transaction receives two confirmations, the receiving exchange can credit the user’s account without the risk of having a double-spend, typically in less than three minutes from when the original transaction was sent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="institutional-traders">
<h4>Institutional Traders<a class="headerlink" href="#institutional-traders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Without Liquid, traders must split their funds allocated on different exchanges in order to take advantage of advantageous situations that may emerge within markets. This leaves the trader open to the risk of losing funds on a compromised exchange, and limits the amount that can be traded due to the elongated process of moving funds to another exchange.  Moving funds between an exchange can take over an hour, letting trade opportunities potentially slip away.</p>
<p>With Liquid, traders can hold their funds in their own wallet within Liquid and send very quickly to any exchange that supports Liquid deposits to trade within minutes. In this scenario, an exchange sees a trading opportunity at Exchange A and can quickly deposit in around 2 minutes onto an exchange. Once trading is complete, the trader can now move the funds back to their own Liquid wallet or to another exchange. Custodial risk is now moved from a single exchange to the entire Liquid federation.</p>

<h3>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This guide will show you how to set up and run a Liquid node from scratch.</p>
<p>Liquid is built using open-source <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements">Elements</a> code. This is why we’ll download the application from the Elements
repository, execute commands against elementsd (daemon) and elements-cli (client), and edit things like the elements.conf config file.</p>

<span id="quickstart-installing"></span><h3>Installing and running Liquid<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-and-running-liquid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>1. Downloading Liquid</strong></p>
<p>Download the latest application setup files from the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/releases">release page</a>.
For example:</p>
<p>Ubuntu: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">elements-&lt;version&gt;-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz</span></code></p>
<p>MacOS: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">elements-&lt;version&gt;-osx-unsigned.dmg</span></code></p>
<p>Windows: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">elements-&lt;version&gt;-win64-setup-unsigned.exe</span></code></p>
<p>Raspberry Pi: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">elements-&lt;version&gt;-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz</span></code></p>
<p><strong>2. Installing Liquid</strong></p>
<p>Run the file you downloaded to install Liquid on your machine.</p>
<p>MacOS users should note: When you double click the downloaded “.dmg” file it will appear on the left hand panel in Finder as “Elements-Core”. If you select that then you will be able to drag the application into the Applications folder.</p>
<p><strong>3. Running Liquid</strong></p>
<p>The Liquid desktop application is named “Elements Core”.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>

<p>Click OK to accept the default data directory.</p>
<p>The first time Liquid runs, it will create a data directory for you and, if you do not have a Bitcoin node running on your machine, notifies you that it “cannot get a valid response from the mainchain daemon” and then closes the application. This just means that it cannot connect to a local Bitcoin node.</p>

<p>Liquid is built using open-source <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements">Elements</a>
code. This is why we’ll download the application from the Elements repository, execute
commands against elementsd (daemon) and elements-cli (client), and edit things like the
elements.conf config file.</p>
<p>As the Elements code defaults to using the live Liquid network, we’ll be referring to
installing and running Liquid, and not Elements, within this guide and throughout the
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.blockstream.com">docs.blockstream.com</a> site.</p>
<p>In this section we will look at how to install and run a full Liquid client node and use
the configuration file to switch the node between:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Connecting to the live Liquid network.</p></li>
<li><p>Running in a local test/development mode (similar to Bitcoin’s “regtest”).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When run against the live Liquid network, our node will be able to connect to other Liquid
network peers, allowing it to receive, validate and relay transactions and blocks.</p>
<p>In local test/development mode, our node will start its own copy of a new Liquid
blockchain. The live and test chains will be stored in different folders on your machine,
so they will never conflict with each other and the wallets will remain separate. This
allows us to perform actions like sending funds, issuing assets, and generating blocks
without fear of losing real funds.</p>
<p>When connected to the live network, our node will act as a “client” node. Other nodes on
the network, called <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#to-functionary"><span class="std std-ref">Functionary</span></a> nodes, are responsible for
securing the transfer of Bitcoin in to and out of the Liquid network and also for the
creation of blocks through the block signing process. The blocks these Functionary nodes
create are then relayed to other network participants. When our node runs in local test
mode, we will be able to generate blocks ourselves, making the development and testing
process a lot simpler. You can read more about the different types of Liquid nodes and
the roles they play on the network in the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#technical-overview"><span class="std std-ref">Technical Overview</span></a>.</p>
<p>To set a Liquid node up we need to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Download/install the Liquid binaries.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure our node using a configuration file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Before we begin, it is worth giving a brief overview of the applications we will be
downloading and using.</p>
<p><strong>Liquid Daemon (elementsd)</strong></p>
<p>A Liquid node that runs as a background service. It can also processes requests made from
other applications using Remote Procedure Call (RPC). It cannot be run at the same time as
elements-qt if they share the same data directory, which they will by default.</p>
<p><strong>Liquid Core/QT (elements-qt)</strong></p>
<p>A desktop application (GUI/front-end) that serves as a Liquid node. It can also process
requests using Remote Procedure Call (RPC). It cannot be run at the same time as elements
if they share the same data directory, which they will by default.</p>
<p><strong>Liquid Client (elements-cli)</strong></p>
<p>A client application that allows you to make calls to elementsd or elements-qt by issuing
RPC commands. Use of elements-cli is detailed in the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#developer-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Developer Guide</span></a>
section.</p>
<p>Liquid will, by default, try and connect to a local Bitcoin node in order to validate
transactions where bitcoin are moved into the Liquid network (called a peg-in). We will
assume that you have already installed and set up a Bitcoin node before moving on with
installing Liquid. This requirement can be switched off by setting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">validatepegin=0</span></code>
within the <a class="reference internal" href="#node-configuration"><span class="std std-ref">Liquid configuration</span></a> (elements.conf) file, but we
advise against disabling peg-in validation unless you are aware of the implications,
running in a testing environment, or are not dealing with large amounts of funds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installation">
<h3>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The applications listed above can be downloaded from the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/releases">Elements Github repository</a> as either an installation/setup
package or as the contents of a compressed file.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>After you have followed the install instructions below (you will find variants
for Linux, Windows, and MacOS) do not run the software until you have followed the
instructions in the Configuration section.</p>
</div>
<p>Some releases are ‘code only’ releases. If you only want to use the binaries, select the
most recent release that has associated binary installation files. Using the 0.17 release
(the latest at time of writing) as an example:</p>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of Linux distrutions supported. For example; Ubuntu users can choose
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">elements-&lt;version&gt;-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz</span></code> file, whereas Raspberry Pi users should
choose the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">elements-&lt;version&gt;-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz</span></code> file.</p>
<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
<p>You can choose the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">elements-&lt;version&gt;-win64-setup-unsigned.exe</span></code> file if you are happy to
run an unsigned setup on your Windows x64 machine. If you need a 32bit variant or a
version without an installer, you should chose the appropriate file from the list.</p>
<p><strong>MacOS Installation</strong></p>
<p>You can choose the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">elements-&lt;version&gt;-osx-unsigned.dmg</span></code> dmg image file, or download the
binaries themselves.</p>
<p>After installation, you are now ready to move on to configuring your node.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration">
<span id="node-configuration"></span><h3>Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This guide assumes you are already running a Bitcoin full node. To allow Liquid Core to
communicate with your Bitcoin node, certain parameters must be set in your Bitcoin
configuration file, and then possibly included in the Liquid configuration file.</p>
<div class="section" id="bitcoin-conf">
<h4>bitcoin.conf<a class="headerlink" href="#bitcoin-conf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>We will first make sure that our Bitcoin node is set up to allow our Liquid node to
communicate with it.</p>
<p>Include the following in your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bitcoin.conf</span></code> file if it is not already present:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>server=1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will ensure that your Bitcoin node creates a ‘cookie’ file within the data directory
it is using on start up. The cookie file allows other applications to locally authenticate
against your Bitcoin node, as long as they know where it is located. Using a cookie file
is the prefered way of authenticating against a Bitcoin node. We will later tell our
Liquid node the location of this file so that it can authenticate against the Bitcoin node.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also use RPC parameters (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rpcuser</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rpcport</span></code>, and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rpcpassword</span></code>) specified in the bitcoin.conf file as the authentication method. If you
want to use the RPC parameter method of allowing access, then also set the following
within bitcoin.conf.</p>
<p><em>Note that the first value will start your Bitcoin node in “regtest” mode so that you can
develop against it - you can omit it if you want to start the node on the live Bitcoin
network</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>regtest=1
regtest.rpcport=18888
regtest.port=18889
rpcuser=&lt;your user&gt;
rpcpassword=&lt;your password&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You may also want to include the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prune</span></code> parameter in your Bitcoin node settings. Pruned
mode reduces disk space requirements but will will not change the initial amount of time
required for download and validation of the chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="elements-conf">
<h4>elements.conf<a class="headerlink" href="#elements-conf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The elementsd, elements-qt and elements-cli applications will all use a configuration file
named elements.conf. The elements.conf file tells elementsd and elements-qt which network
to connect to and can set a number of different behaviours within the applications. It
also tells them what credentials must be provided in order to accept an RPC request. The
elements-cli application uses the configuration file to obtain the correct credentials in
order to communicate with elementsd or elements-qt using RPC.</p>
<p>When you later start either of the three applications you can provide a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">datadir</span></code> path.
The path you provide tells the applications which directory to use to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Obtain RPC authentication data (user, password, port).</p></li>
<li><p>Store blockchain and wallet data.</p></li>
<li><p>Store log files etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use a different data directory that the defaults referenced below, for
example an external hard drive, you can follow <a class="reference external" href="https://bitzuma.com/posts/moving-the-bitcoin-core-data-directory/">this guide</a>.</p>
<p>The elements.conf configuration file is located in the following places by default. If you
do not see the Liquid directory and the elements.config file you should create them now.
Otherwise, open the elements.conf file for editing.</p>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.elements/</span></code></p>
<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%homepath%\AppData\Roaming\Elements</span></code></p>
<p><strong>MacOS</strong></p>
<p>As the Library file is hidden, you can access it by opening Finder, selecting ‘Go’ then
‘Go to Folder’ from the menu and then entering the path as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/Library</span></code>. From there you
can go into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Application</span> <span class="pre">Support</span></code> folder and create the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Elements</span></code> folder. Once
you have created the Elements folder, you can run the following from the Terminal app to
create the Liquid config file:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">touch</span> <span class="pre">&quot;Library/Application</span> <span class="pre">Support/Elements/elements.conf&quot;</span></code></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>After making any changes to elements.conf in the future, you will need to restart your
Liquid node so that they take effect.</p>
</div>
<p>If your Bitcoin node is installed in the default location, Liquid should automatically
find it when you later start it. If you use a non-default location for your Bitcoin node,
you will also have to add the following parameter to your elements.conf file, pointing to
the cookie file created by your Bitcoin node:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mainchainrpccookiefile=&lt;location_of_your_bitcoin_cookie_file&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you want to use the RPC parameter method of allowing access to your Bitcoin node then
also set the following within elements.conf, using the same user, password, and port that
you set in bitcoin.conf:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mainchainrpcport=&lt;18888_for_example&gt;
mainchainrpcuser=&lt;your_bitcoin_rpc_user_here&gt;
mainchainrpcpassword=&lt;your_bitcoin_rpc_password_here&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you want to allow your Liquid node to accept RPC requests (such as those used in the
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#developer-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Developer Guide</span></a>) then also set the following.</p>
<p><em>Note that these values will start your Liquid node in test/development mode. To start in
live Liquid network mode, set the chain value to liquidv1</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>chain=elementsregtest

elementsregtest.port=&lt;18886_for_example&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>To switch between live and test/development modes you will need to change the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chain</span></code>

restart your node for these to take effect if you change them in the future. Be sure
to also change the mode your Bitcoin node runs in if you do this.</p>
</div>
<p>If you do not wish to validate peg-ins against your Bitcoin node, you can set the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">validatepegin</span></code> parameter to a value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code>. This can be done either in the

<p>The code examples listed below show you how to make use of the most common features of Liquid. Each example uses the command line and the Liquid Client application (elements-cli) to issue commands to either the Liquid daemon (elementsd) or Liquid Core GUI (elements-qt), depending on which you are running.</p>
<p>The example code can be modified to work in other languages like Python, C#, Ruby, Go, Perl, and Java by following the steps in the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#liquid-app-examples"><span class="std std-ref">App Examples</span></a> section and issuing the appropriate RPC commands to Liquid using your chosen language instead of via elements-cli.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that any examples on the <a class="reference external" href="https://elementsproject.org/elements-code-tutorial/application-development">Elements website</a> will also work on Liquid, as Liquid is built using the Elements codebase.

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Basic Commands</a><a class="headerlink" href="#basic-commands" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Liquid Client (elements-cli) application allows you to issue Remote Procedure Call (RPC) commands to the Liquid Daemon (elementsd) or Liquid Core GUI (elements-qt) from the terminal.</p>
<p>A full list of all the commands you can issue over RPC can be be seen by running:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>elements-cli <span class="nb">help</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To see further information on how to use a certain command you can append the name of the command like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>elements-cli <span class="nb">help</span> sendtoaddress
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This returns examples of how to use the command, a list of arguments that can be passed to it and and the format of the results returned.</p>
<p>If you run the above code you will see that the sendtoaddress accepts 2 mandatory arguments and has 8 additional optional arguments.</p>
<p>For example, to use the sendtoaddress command to send an amount of 1 L-BTC and subtract the fee from the amount being sent we would run:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>elements-cli sendtoaddress AzppUfWkYpjiThupf2t6Kn1yPTgseg3buBexuMSbZxpPWAsQcucHXFpr4HHGFQAiyBiddvcjAYyoVeMD <span class="m">1</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The result returned from sendtoaddress is the transaction id. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>466c7da2555f0e1e8eff0188cbf7ba0e44fae03a61b81a1226c34ed785e4bb58
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The result was returned as a string value. Many results are returned as JSON formatted data however. Using getwalletinfo as an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>elements-cli getwalletinfo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This returns JSON formatted data similar to that below:</p>

<span id="to-confidential-transactions"></span><h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Confidential Transactions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#confidential-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All addresses in Liquid are, by default, blinded using Confidential Transactions. Blinding is the process by which the amount and type of asset being transferred is cryptographically hidden from everyone except the sending and receiving parties. This is done using a blinding key, which we will look at later.</p>
<p>Imagine that our cryptographic friends Alice and Bob are running Liquid nodes. We’ll have Bob send some assets to himself using a blinded Liquid address as the destination.</p>
<p>First Bob will generate a new address and store it in a variable named “ADDR” so he can recall it for use later:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ <span class="nv">ADDR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli getnewaddress<span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To see the new address Bob created he can print out the value that was stored in the “ADDR” variable.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$ADDR</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>We will use the “store the value returned from an RPC command in a variable for future use” technique throughout the rest of the code examples. We’ll print out the contents of a variable every now and again when highlighting something that has been returned. You can always just echo out the contents of any others as we go along should you want to.</p>
</div>
<p>After running the echo command above you should see something similar to this:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Azpr7BwzjwdiB1pNZKcLkk6Esn5NWAE7wtrC4UzEsshpKe3eUZzPQBvfJ7q9wzJLbt9yn8hYZmZDayGG
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>As of Liquid v0.17, getnewaddress defaults to creating P2SH-P2WPKH addresses. You can create “CTE” prefixed addresses (the default for versions of Liquid previous to 0.17) by calling getnewaddress like this: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">elements-cli</span> <span class="pre">getnewaddress</span> <span class="pre">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="pre">legacy</span></code>. You can also set the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">addresstype=legacy</span></code> argument on node startup, or set it in your config file to always get legacy addresses from “getnewaddress”. Some commands require a “legacy” style address in order to work, such as message signing.</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s look at the address in more detail to check that it is indeed a confidential one. To do this we can use the “getaddressinfo” command, passing in the address that we stored in the ADDR variable as a parameter:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ getaddressinfo <span class="nv">$ADDR</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You should see a long value for the “confidential_key” property within the JSON formatted results. It will look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;confidential_key&quot;: &quot;030788da8d9ca229cbe57e346daaf8d94cba3ed548b41922a8abefaec91ff1abb1&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The confidential_key is the public blinding key, which has been added to the address and is the reason why a confdential address is so long. You will also see that the “getaddressinfo” command shows an associated “unconfidential” address, which can be used to receive assets if you don’t want to make use of the Confidential Transaction feature for some reason.</p>
<p>We’ll now send an amount of 1 “bitcoin” (L-BTC) from Bob’s wallet to the new address we generated for him:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ <span class="nv">TXID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli sendtoaddress <span class="nv">$ADDR</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In order to have the transaction confirm we need a block to be generated. As an aside, at this stage we can query the mempool of each of our Liquid nodes to see the transaction waiting to be added to a block, as well as the current block count of each node’s blockchain:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli getrawmempool
Bob:~$ elements-cli getrawmempool
Alice:~$ elements-cli getblockcount
Bob:~$ elements-cli getblockcount
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Both should display results including the transaction with the same ID as that stored in the “TXID” variable and the same block count value. Once a new block has been created, we can check the mempool again for each client to see that the transaction has been confirmed:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli generatetoaddress <span class="m">1</span> <span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli getnewaddress<span class="k">)</span>
Alice:~$ elements-cli getrawmempool
Bob:~$ elements-cli getrawmempool
Alice:~$ elements-cli getblockcount
Bob:~$ elements-cli getblockcount
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that although Bob sent an amount of 1 L-BTC to himself the net effect is that he now has slightly less than he did before, this is because some of the transaction amount was spent on fees that have yet to mature and be seen as spendable.</p>
<p>The above shows that the client’s blockchains and mempools are in sync. If they are not, wait a few seconds and try the calls above again as it may take a moment for the nodes to synchronize. They display the same results because they are connected nodes on the same Liquid network and broadcast transactions and blocks between each other in very much the same was as Bitcoin nodes do.</p>
<p>Now let’s examine the transaction as it is seen by Bob’s wallet and also how it is seen from the point of view of Alice’s wallet. First the view from Bob’s wallet:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli gettransaction <span class="nv">$TXID</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The output from that initially looks like just a huge random assortment of letters and numbers (the hex value of the transaction), but if you scroll up you will see some more readable content above that.</p>
<p>Looking in the “details” section near the top, you will see that there are two amount values:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;details&quot;: [
  {
    ...
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;send&quot;,
    &quot;amount&quot;: -1.00000000,
    ...
  },
  {
    ...
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;receive&quot;,
    &quot;amount&quot;: 1.00000000,
    ...
  }
]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And so we can confirm that Bob’s wallet can view the actual amounts being sent and received in this transaction. This is because the blinded transaction was sent from Bob’s own wallet and so it has access to the required data to unblind the amount values. You will also see two other properties and their values within the two details sections: “amountblinder” and “assetblinder”. These indicate that both the asset amount and the type of asset were blinded. This ensures that wallets without knowledge of the blinding key are prevented from viewing them.</p>
<p>Looking at the transaction from Alice’s wallet, we would expect both amount and type to be unknown as they were sent using a Confidential Transaction.</p>
<p>In order to check Alice’s view of the transaction, we need Alice’s node to use the value of the transaction id that we stored in the TXID variable in Bob’s terminal session. When our code examples use a variable that was set by the other node like this, we will assume that you will set the variable across terminal sessions. This can be done by using echo to print the value within one terminal session, copying the value, and then setting it within the other node’s terminal session, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$TXID</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Copy the result, which will be similar to:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>533533c5a382ccf14f4b432130f02871091b6a28594a9481da12f360f711685d
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And then we can set a corresponding variable in Alice’s terminal session, similar to doing the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ <span class="nv">TXID</span><span class="o">=</span>533533c5a382ccf14f4b432130f02871091b6a28594a9481da12f360f711685d
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>You can use this technique whenever we need to use a variable set in one terminal session within another.</p>
</div>
<p>This then allows us to run the code below.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli gettransaction <span class="nv">$TXID</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This causes an error. The reason is that Alice’s wallet will not contain wallet details of the transaction as it does not relate to an address contained in her wallet. We can get the raw transaction data from Alice’s node’s copy of the blockchain using the getrawtransaction command like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli getrawtransaction <span class="nv">$TXID</span> <span class="m">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That returns raw transaction details. If you look within the “vout” section you can see that there are three instances. The first two instances are the receiving and change amounts and the third is the transaction fee. Of these three amounts, the fee is the only one in which you can see a value, as the fee itself is unblinded. For the first two instances you will see (amongst others) properties with values similar to this:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;value-minimum&quot;: 0.00000001,
&quot;value-maximum&quot;: 11258999.06842624,
&quot;amountcommitment&quot;: &quot;0881c61d8a15ad26e6ef621ca99a188ccebbdb348d5285012393459b7e5b1e6113&quot;,
&quot;assetcommitment&quot;: &quot;0b1b7a1a4a604f4a68b3277e3a8926d74e86adce7b92e8e6ba67f9c5a8ad2cbcf4&quot;,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>What this shows are the “blinded ranges” of the value amounts and the commitment data that acts as proof of the actual amount and type of asset transacted. The raw view of the transaction will be the same accross all nodes, regardless of if they hold the blinding key or not, only the results of gettransaction from a wallet aware of the blinding key used will show the actual amounts.</p>
<p>Even if we were to import Bob’s private key into Alice’s wallet it would still not be able to see the amounts and type of asset using gettransaction because it still has no knowledge of the blinding key used.</p>
<p>If we want to let Alice’s wallet view the actual amount details we’ll need to import the address as ‘watch only’ so gettransaction will work, and then import the blinding key so we can see the unblinded amounts. First, import and then view the transaction. Note the use of the second argument passed to gettransaction, set to true. This tells gettransaction to include watch only addresses, such as the one we imported. Remember to copy the value of $ADDR from Bob’s session and set it in Alice’s before running the code below.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli importaddress <span class="nv">$ADDR</span>
Alice:~$ elements-cli gettransaction <span class="nv">$TXID</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This time the call to gettransaction does not error but, because Alice still does not know the blinding key, the amount (towards the top of the output) will show as:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;amount&quot;: {
  &quot;bitcoin&quot;: 0.00000000

<p>Without knowledge of the Blinding Key, the amount and type of asset being transacted is still hidden.</p>
<p>In order for anyone else apart from the sender and receiver of a Confidential Transaction (such as an auditor) to view the amount and type of assets being transacted, they need to know the blinding key that was used to generate the blinded address. To show this, we can export the blinding key Bob’s wallet used for the related address, import it into Alice’s wallet and try to view the transaction again. Let’s export the key for that particular address from Bob’s wallet and import it into Alice’s.</p>
<p>Export Bob’s blinding key for the address:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ <span class="nv">BOBBLINDINGKEY</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli dumpblindingkey <span class="nv">$ADDR</span><span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Echo, copy and set the variable accross terminal sessions again like we did above (steps not shown) and then import Bob’s blinding key into Alice’s wallet:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli importblindingkey <span class="nv">$ADDR</span> <span class="nv">$BOBBLINDINGKEY</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now that Alice’s wallet has knowledge of the blinding key used on that address, we can run the checks we did above from Alice’s wallet, this time expecting to see the actual amount value:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli gettransaction <span class="nv">$TXID</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Magic! Alice’s wallet now shows the actual value sent in the transaction.</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;amount&quot;: {
  &quot;bitcoin&quot;: 1.00000000
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We’ve seen that the use of a blinding key hides the amount and type of assets in an address and that by importing the right blinding key, we can reveal those values. In practical use, a blinding key may be given to an auditor, should there be a need to verify the amounts and types of assets held by a party. The Confidential Transactions feature of Liquid also allows for “range proofs” to be performed without the need to expose actual amounts. This allows statements such as “address abc holds at least an amount x of asset y” to be cryptographically proven as true or false.</p>

<p>In this example we’ll issue our own asset, label it, look at the re-issuance token, and learn how to send the asset to other other Liquid nodes and wallet addresses. We’ll also take a look at how to keep track of what assets have been issued and re-issued.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at Alice’s wallet to see what it currently holds.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli getwalletinfo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We see that Alice holds a lot of the “bitcoin” asset and nothing else:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;balance&quot;: {
  &quot;bitcoin&quot;: 101.00000000
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Every asset you issue within Liquid (including the “bitcoin” default) will be assigned its own hex value. This is used to uniquely identify it on the network. Notice how “bitcoin” is displayed with a readable asset name. This is because Liquid automatically associates the label “bitcoin” with the asset hex for that default asset. To find out its hex value we can run:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli dumpassetlabels
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Which returns:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;bitcoin&quot;: &quot;cc5fb67403bee3b9a74e7518b7684d6cb64041e4156970a17aa653ee336b1097&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>One of the main features of Liquid is the ability to issue your own assets.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>There is nothing inherently different between assets in the way they are handled within the Liquid protocol.</p>
</div>
<p>Run the following to perform a blinded issuance of 100 of a new asset, along with 1 reissuance token for the asset.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ <span class="nv">ISSUE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli issueasset <span class="m">100</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>To manually issue an asset using the rawissueasset command, please see the Creating Raw Issuances example. Additionally, the Proof of Issuance example shows how to prove that you were the one who issued the asset using the “contract hash” parameter.</p>
</div>
<p>That will create a new asset type, an initial supply of 100 and also 1 reissuance token. The reissuance token is used to prove authority to reissue more of the asset at a later date. We have issued one such token in the command above. The token is transferable and you can initially create as many as you think you will need based upon how many of the network participants will need to perform this duty. Each asset has its own reissuance token. We’ll look at this in more detail later. It is also possibly to create an asset with no reissuance tokens by using zero for that argument.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>The minimum amount of an asset you can issue is 0.00000001. This is also the smallest amount of any issued asset that you can send. The minimum amount of the default asset that you can send (L-BTC) is higher, at 0.00001. These differ as the default asset considers the minimum send amount of the Bitcoin network’s dust limit. The maximum amount of an asset you can issue is 21,000,000 although more can be created by reissuing. When you create the reissuance token as above, where the amount was 1, you are actually creating 100,000,000 of them when measured in their smallest denomination. This is because they are divisible like every other asset on Liquid. The 1 is little more than a user interface concession. For ease of readability we will refer to this issuance as “one token”.</p>
</div>
<p>We have stored all of the returned data from the issuance command in a variable named “ISSUE”, which we’ll pull the hex of the new asset from, storing that value in another variable named “ASSET”. We’ll also store the “token” value (which we’ll explain and use later) and the “txid” and “vin” of the issuance, which will be used when we try and unblind the issuing transaction shortly.</p>
<p>In order to do this we can use a tool called <a class="reference external" href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> (which we installed as part of the tutorial dependencies) to strip out and store only the parts returned and saved within “ISSUE” that we are interested in:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ <span class="nv">ASSET</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$ISSUE</span> <span class="p">|</span> jq <span class="s1">&#39;.asset&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> tr -d <span class="s1">&#39;&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>

Alice:~$ <span class="nv">ITXID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$ISSUE</span> <span class="p">|</span> jq <span class="s1">&#39;.txid&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> tr -d <span class="s1">&#39;&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>
Alice:~$ <span class="nv">IVIN</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$ISSUE</span> <span class="p">|</span> jq <span class="s1">&#39;.vin&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> tr -d <span class="s1">&#39;&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To see the hex identifier for the asset we issued run:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$ASSET</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Which will return something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>f0379482f9b77917670be0f060cc58debc6d93db0bf857458d5fb19080c8ab67
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In order to view all asset issuances that have been made we run the “listissuances” command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli listissuances
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That will show the asset we just issued. You’ll notice tha it has the following property:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;isreissuance&quot;: false,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This indicates that it was an original issuance and not a reissuances. You’ll also see that the newly issued asset does not have an “assetlabel”.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Asset labels are not part of network protocol consensus and are local only to each node. You should not rely on them for transaction processing but instead use the asset’s hex value, which is shared across the network.</p>
</div>
<p>You can set the label by assigning it against the hex identifier of the asset. This can be done in the relevant Liquid.conf file by adding a line:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assetdir=asset_hex_here:your_label_here
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or you can do this by passing in “assetdir” as a parameter when you start the node. We’ll do this now and call our new asset “demoasset”. We need to stop the node first.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli stop
Alice:~$ elementsd -assetdir<span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$ASSET</span>:demoasset
Alice:~$ elements-cli listissuances
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This shows that the asset we issued has the label we assigned to its hex value:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;assetlabel&quot;: &quot;demoasset&quot;,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Having labelled our asset for ease of reference, we will now look at the issuance data for “demoasset” in more detail. You will notice a “token” property similar to that below:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;token&quot;: &quot;33244cc19dd9df0fd901e27246e3413c8f6a560451e2f3721fb6f636791087c7&quot;,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is the hex of the token and it can be used to reissue the asset. Yours will likely differ from the actual value above. There is also a “tokenamount” property which corresponds to the amount we created:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;tokenamount&quot;: 1.00000000,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When the transaction has confirmed, we can take a look using Bob’s wallet to see if it is aware of Alice’s asset issuance:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli listissuances
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Bob’s wallet isn’t aware of the issuance, so we’ll import the address into his wallet.</p>
<p>In order to check Bob’s view of the issuance, we need Bob’s node to use the address used when Alice issued the asset. As that’s currently known to Alice’s node, we need to copy the information over to Bob’s node. This can be done by using echo to print the value within one terminal session, copying the value, and then setting it within the other node’s terminal session, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ <span class="nv">IADDR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli gettransaction <span class="nv">$ITXID</span> <span class="p">|</span> jq <span class="s1">&#39;.details[0].address&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> tr -d <span class="s1">&#39;&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>
Alice:~$ <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$IADDR</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Copy the result, which will be similar to:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>AzpkDFjr6nNm4nncoBHuZr5S2zH4wPEpTvU63M8jNuU7JMXAVb5rVNCYmLB3fTmP9kLGgTAdCTwrrndu
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And then we can set a corresponding variable in Bob’s terminal session, similar to doing the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ <span class="nv">IADDR</span><span class="o">=</span>AzpkDFjr6nNm4nncoBHuZr5S2zH4wPEpTvU63M8jNuU7JMXAVb5rVNCYmLB3fTmP9kLGgTAdCTwrrndu
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>You can use this technique whenever we need to use a variable set in one terminal session within another.</p>
</div>
<p>Bob can now import the address relating to Alice’s issuance:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli importaddress <span class="nv">$IADDR</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If we try and view the list of issuances from Bob’s node now we’ll see the issuance, but notice that the amount of the asset and the amount of its associated token are hidden:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli listissuances
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The asset amount and the token amount are both blinded and show as -1:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;tokenamount&quot;: -1,
&quot;assetamount&quot;: -1,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the Confidential Transactions example, we were able to expose the amount and type of asset being sent in a regular Confidential Transaction by exporting the blinding key used to create the blinded address and importing it into another wallet. We can do the same type of thing with the issuance transaction using the issuance blinding key.</p>
<p>First, we need to export the issuance blinding key. We refer to issuances by their txid/vin pair. As there is only one per input it will be zero, but we’ll use the value we saved earlier as it is good practice to not rely on such things staying fixed. You will need to echo, copy and create the appropriate variables (ISSUEKEY, ITXID, IVIN) in Bob’s node as we did above for this to work (steps not shown).</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ <span class="nv">ISSUEKEY</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli dumpissuanceblindingkey <span class="nv">$ITXID</span> <span class="nv">$IVIN</span><span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli importissuanceblindingkey <span class="nv">$ITXID</span> <span class="nv">$IVIN</span> <span class="nv">$ISSUEKEY</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now when we run the command to list known issuances from Bob’s wallet we should see the actual values:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli listissuances
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Which returns:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;tokenamount&quot;: 1.00000000,
&quot;assetamount&quot;: 100.00000000,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Indeed, Bob’s wallet can now see both the amount of the asset and its reissuance token that were issued.</p>
<p>Just like any other asset in Liquid, we can send our “demoasset” from Alice’s address to Bob’s using the “sendtoaddress” command. This differs from its implementation in Bitcoin’s source code in that it accepts an additional parameter, which allows you to specify the type of asset to be sent. Be aware that the step above where we imported the issuance blinding key is not required in order to transact an issued asset between addresses and wallets. Importing the issuance blinding key just enables another wallet to view the issuance details in full.</p>
<p>You will need to echo, copy and create the appropriate variable (BOBDEMOADD) in Alice’s node as we did above for this to work (steps not shown).</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ <span class="nv">BOBDEMOADD</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli getnewaddress<span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli sendtoaddress <span class="nv">$BOBDEMOADD</span> <span class="m">10</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="nb">false</span> <span class="nb">false</span> <span class="m">1</span> UNSET demoasset
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After confirmation, Bob’s wallet will now show an amount of 10 “demoasset” and Alice’s will show 90:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli getwalletinfo
Alice:~$ elements-cli getwalletinfo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As we didn’t assign a label in Bob’s node for the asset we created, it will be identified by its hex value instead. We will therefore have to use the hex identifier instead of the asset label when we send it from his node. Remember that asset labels are local only to each node and are not part of the network’s protocol rules. We’ll demonstrate how Bob can send the asset using the hex value by transferring the 10 “demoasset” back to Alice:</p>
<p>You will need to echo, copy and create the appropriate variable (ALICEDEMOADD) in Bob’s node as we did above for this to work (steps not shown).</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ <span class="nv">ALICEDEMOADD</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli getnewaddress<span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli sendtoaddress <span class="nv">$ALICEDEMOADD</span> <span class="m">10</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="nb">false</span> <span class="nb">false</span> <span class="m">1</span> UNSET <span class="nv">$ASSET</span>
Bob:~$ <span class="nv">ADDRGEN</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli getnewaddress<span class="k">)</span>
Bob:~$ elements-cli generatetoaddress <span class="m">1</span> <span class="nv">$ADDRGEN</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We should see that Bob’s wallet has no “demoasset” in it anymore and Alice’s is back to 100:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli getwalletinfo
Alice:~$ elements-cli getwalletinfo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can see that is indeed the case.</p>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="reissuing-assets">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Reissuing Assets</a><a class="headerlink" href="#reissuing-assets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this section we’ll look at reissuing an amount of the asset we previously issued. We’ll re-use the asset hex we stored in the “ASSET” variable. Reissuing just means “creating some more of” in this context. For future use, we’ll store the result of the “reissueasset” command in a variable named “RTRANS” and from that, strip out the transaction ID, storing it in another variable named “RTXID”:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ <span class="nv">RTRANS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli reissueasset <span class="nv">$ASSET</span> <span class="m">99</span><span class="k">)</span>
Alice:~$ <span class="nv">RTXID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$RTRANS</span> <span class="p">|</span> jq <span class="s1">&#39;.txid&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> tr -d <span class="s1">&#39;&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We’ve just created 99 more units of our new asset. As an aside, because we already labelled the asset in the previous example, we could have also passed “demoasset” in as the first parameter instead of the hex identifier and it would have worked exactly the same.</p>
<p>To check this issuance history of our asset (and ignore the “bitcoin” issuance) we can run the “listissuances” command and specify the asset we are interested in:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli listissuances <span class="nv">$ASSET</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For the above command you may also pass the asset label in instead of the hex value. As has been noted before, be aware that labels are stored locally and are not network-wide.</p>
<p>Along with the original issuance you should see a new entry with the following property:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;isreissuance&quot;: true,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This property allows us to differentiate between initial issuances and reissuances. Note that the transaction id where amounts of the asset were created is also included in the returned data.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the details of the transaction where we reissued our asset:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli gettransaction <span class="nv">$RTXID</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Scroll to the top of the returned transaction data as there are a few things worth noting here. The first is that within the “amount” section we can see that 0 “bitcoin” and 99 “demoasset” were transacted:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;amount&quot;: {
  &quot;bitcoin&quot;: 0.00000000,
  &quot;33244cc19dd9df0fd901e27246e3413c8f6a560451e2f3721fb6f636791087c7&quot;: 0.00000000,
  &quot;demoasset&quot;: 99.00000000,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This information suggests that an Liquid transaction can transact more than one type of asset within the same transaction, which is indeed the case.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>To send different types of asset in the same transaction, the “sendmany” command is used. The syntax is the same as in Bitcoin.</p>
</div>
<p>The “amount” section shows the net effect of the transaction as: 0 “bitcoin”, 99 “demoasset” and also another asset that is 0. That unlabelled asset is our reissuance token (the hex for which will differ from that above but the results are otherwise the same). What this shows is that once the sent and received amounts are totalled we have created 99 “demoasset”. You can see how the values in the “amount” section are derived by scrolling down the returned data and looking within the “details” section.</p>
<p>You will see that amounts of 99 “demoasset” and 1 reissuance token were sent:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;category&quot;: &quot;send&quot;,
&quot;amount&quot;: -99.00000000,

&quot;category&quot;: &quot;send&quot;,
&quot;amount&quot;: -1.00000000,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And that further on the same amounts were received:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;category&quot;: &quot;receive&quot;,
&quot;amount&quot;: 99.00000000,

&quot;category&quot;: &quot;receive&quot;,
&quot;amount&quot;: 1.00000000,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can see how the “amount” section above therefore lists the net transfer of 0 (-1 +1) tokens. The reason why the net of this is the creation of 99 new “demoasset” is that the “reissueasset” command essentially spends from a zero balance address, and so the received amount has the effect of creating 99 new “demoasset”. The 99 new “demoasset” are basically spent into existence. It is worth highlighting again that in order to reissue an asset you must hold a related reissuance token. They must therefore be allocated wisely.</p>
<p>To check that the blinding works the same for a reissuance transaction as it does for a normal transaction we can check Bob’s view of Alice’s reissuance transaction. Wait until a block is confirmed to let the nodes sync, then run the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ <span class="nv">RAWRTRANS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli getrawtransaction <span class="nv">$RTXID</span><span class="k">)</span>
Bob:~$ elements-cli decoderawtransaction <span class="nv">$RAWRTRANS</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can see that the amounts and asset types are indeed blinded with results like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;value-minimum&quot;: 0.00000001,
&quot;value-maximum&quot;: 42.94967296,
</pre></div>

<p>You could unblind these using the techniques we used for the initial issuance should you want to.</p>
<p>We have seen that reissuance is just a special kind of spending transaction whereby you can create more of the original asset, so long as you hold a valid reissuance token in your wallet. Next we will look at how to transfer the reissuance tokens.</p>
<p>Let’s send the reissuance token from Alice to Bob so that Bob can reissue some “demoasset” himself. Note that if there was always going to be a need for them both to reissue the asset at the same time, we could have just created two reissuance tokens and initially sent one to Bob, leaving Alice still holding the other. Either way, we would need to send from one wallet to the other, so let’s begin. First we’ll double check that Alice’s wallet currently holds the reissuance token and Bob’s does not:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli getwalletinfo
Bob:~$ elements-cli getwalletinfo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Alice’s wallet has “bitcoin”, “demoasset” and the demo asset’s reissuance token whereas Bob’s only has “bitcoin”.</p>
<p>We’ll just prove that the token is needed to reissue by trying to reissue from Bob’s wallet without the token:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli reissueasset <span class="nv">$ASSET</span> <span class="m">10</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That fails as expected and gives the following error message:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>No available reissuance tokens in wallet.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So let’s send the reissuance token to Bob so that he can reissue some of our “demoasset”. Have Bob’s wallet generate a new address and save it in a variable:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ <span class="nv">RITRECADD</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli getnewaddress<span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Send the token from Alice’s wallet to Bob’s new address as if it were any other asset. We’ll use the hex of the token to say what type of asset we are sending and also generate a block so the transaction confirms:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli sendtoaddress <span class="nv">$RITRECADD</span> <span class="m">1</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span> <span class="nb">false</span> <span class="nb">false</span> <span class="m">1</span> UNSET <span class="nv">$TOKEN</span>
Alice:~$ elements-cli generatetoaddress <span class="m">1</span> <span class="nv">$ADDRGEN</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Check that Bob’s wallet now has the token and that Alice’s no longer does:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli getwalletinfo
Bob:~$ elements-cli getwalletinfo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The token and right to reissue it provides is now Bob’s!</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Remember from an earlier note that we can divide a reissuance token like any other asset in Liquid. Our send of “1” token in this instance actually transferred 100,000,000 of the smallest possible amount of the token. You can try sending something like “0.1” of the token back to Alice and check if she is again able to reissue (she will and so will Bob, who will still hold “0.9”).</p>
</div>
<p>Bob still doesn’t have any of the “demoasset” itself yet but, now that his wallet holds the reissuance token, he can reissue any amount of “demoasset” and it will show in his wallet:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ <span class="nv">RISSUE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli reissueasset <span class="nv">$ASSET</span> <span class="m">10</span><span class="k">)</span>
Bob:~$ elements-cli getwalletinfo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Bob’s wallet now has “bitcoin”, the reissuance token for our new asset, and an amount of the new asset itself:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;balance&quot;: {
  &quot;bitcoin&quot;: 10499998.99841940,
  &quot;78ee1e3b9f2edf730e7f624e9d0f92d3e1d364c0ee91525bbccf56377dcd5033&quot;: 1.00000000,
  &quot;600010d2a60cf0d9395dced79af3ccdb7c908e80cddf125ed1af80dc87186aae&quot;: 10.00000000
},
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Remember that the new asset we issued will still only display using its hex value in Bob’s wallet as we didn’t assign it a label like we did in Alice’s wallet. In order for Alice to see this reissuance we need to make her wallet aware of it. Show that Alice’s wallet can’t see it:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli listissuances
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Import the address so that it can:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ <span class="nv">RITXID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$RISSUE</span> <span class="p">|</span> jq <span class="s1">&#39;.txid&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> tr -d <span class="s1">&#39;&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>
Bob:~$ <span class="nv">RIADDR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli gettransaction <span class="nv">$RITXID</span> <span class="p">|</span> jq <span class="s1">&#39;.details[0].address&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> tr -d <span class="s1">&#39;&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>
Alice:~$ elements-cli importaddress <span class="nv">$RIADDR</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now Alice’s wallet can see the reissuance:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli listissuances
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As expected though, the amounts are blinded. You can unblind by importing the blinding key as we did earlier should you want to.</p>
<p>In Liquid you can also carry out an unblinded asset issue:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ <span class="nv">UBRISSUE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli issueasset <span class="m">55</span> <span class="m">1</span> <span class="nb">false</span><span class="k">)</span>
Bob:~$ <span class="nv">UBASSET</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$UBRISSUE</span> <span class="p">|</span> jq <span class="s1">&#39;.asset&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> tr -d <span class="s1">&#39;&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Which shows up as normal in Bob’s wallet after he issues it:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli getwalletinfo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And this time if we import the address into Alice’s wallet she should be able to see the amount issued, proving it was issued unblinded. Following the same process as before to import the address into Alice’s wallet:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli listissuances
Bob:~$ <span class="nv">UBRITXID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$UBRISSUE</span> <span class="p">|</span> jq <span class="s1">&#39;.txid&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> tr -d <span class="s1">&#39;&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>
Bob:~$ <span class="nv">UBRIADDR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>elements-cli gettransaction <span class="nv">$UBRITXID</span> <span class="p">|</span> jq <span class="s1">&#39;.details[0].address&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> tr -d <span class="s1">&#39;&quot;&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>
Alice:~$ elements-cli importaddress <span class="nv">$UBRIADDR</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can now see that Alice’s wallet can see both the issuance and the amount issued (55) without the need to import the blinding key:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Alice:~$ elements-cli listissuances
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It may also be necessary to destroy asset amounts as well as create them in an Liquid based blockchain. This is easily done using the “destroyamount” command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli destroyamount <span class="nv">$UBASSET</span> <span class="m">5</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Check the amount has gone from the 55 issued down to 50:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bob:~$ elements-cli getwalletinfo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It will show the amount as 50, proving that an amount of 5 were indeed destroyed:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;balance&quot;: {
  &quot;4021bf6faac59d7ec593859a741318752f72e637e7d5ecfa54725dba1508771b&quot;: 50.00000000,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Creating, reissuing and destroying assets is a key feature of Liquid that can help you reflect the real world movement of assets or tokens on another blockchains etc.</p>

<p>This example shows how to use Blockstream’s <a class="reference external" href="https://assets.blockstream.info">Liquid Asset Registry</a>. The asset registry allows you to register an asset and prove ownership against a domain name.</p>
<p>The code below creates an asset, an associated token, and outputs two files:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A ‘liquid-asset-proof-‘ file that must be placed on the server of the registered domain over the entire lifecycle of the asset.</p></li>
<li><p>A ‘register_asset.sh’ file that, when run, will post the asset registration data to Blockstream’s Liquid Asset Registry.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the output files will be explained later.</p>
<p>There are six fields that need setting within the script:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NAME</span></code> The name of the asset as it will apear in the registry and applications that use asset registry data, such as the <a class="reference external" href="https://blockstream.info/liquid/">Blockstream Explorer</a>. Length must be 5 to 255 ascii characters.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TICKER</span></code> The ticker you would like to assign to the asset. Length must be 3 to 5 characters (valid characters are a-z and A-Z).</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DOMAIN</span></code> The domain that will be used to verify the asset. Must be a valid domain name format, for example: example.com or sub.example.com. Do not include the http/s or www prefixes.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ASSET_AMOUNT</span></code> The amount to be issued. It is preferable to consider one satoshi unit as representing one asset. So to issue an amount of 100 of an asset, a value of 0.00000100 should be used. Please note that how this value is displayed within applications that use asset registry data is affected by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PRECISION</span></code> field.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TOKEN_AMOUNT</span></code> The amount of reissuance tokens to be created. It is preferable to consider one satoshi unit as representing one reissuance token, so a value of 0.00000001 will create 0.00000001 reissuance tokens and when viewed from Liquid Core it will also show as 0.00000001. When viewed from an app that uses satoshi sized units, such as the <a class="reference external" href="https://blockstream.info/liquid/">Blockstream Explorer</a> it will show as 1. This field is not affected by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PRECISION</span></code> field.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PRECISION</span></code> The precision used to display the asset amount within applications that use <a class="reference external" href="https://assets.blockstream.info">Liquid Asset Registry</a> data, such as the <a class="reference external" href="https://blockstream.info/liquid/">Blockstream Explorer</a>. Examples: a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PRECISION</span></code> value of 0 for an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ASSET_AMOUNT</span></code> of 0.00000100 will create a value of 0.00000100 when viewed from Liquid Core and 100 when viewed in an app that uses the asset registry data. A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PRECISION</span></code> value of 2 for an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ASSET_AMOUNT</span></code> of 0.00000100 will create a value of 0.00000100 when viewed from Liquid Core and 1.00 when viewed in the same app. The default is 0 and the maximum value is 8.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The code below uses Liquid in live mode. The code can easily be adapted for test use.</p>

</div>
<p>When you have saved the above to the file, edit the variables at the top and of the file and start elements-qt or elementsd using an argument of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-server=1</span></code> to allow the Liquid client to communicate with it. Execute the script from the directory you created it in by opening a Terminal session and running:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>bash issue_and_prepare_register.sh
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In order to register the asset just created:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Wait a couple of minutes for the issuance transaction to confirm.</p></li>
<li><p>Place the ‘liquid-asset-proof-‘ file in a folder named ‘.well-known’ in the root of your domain. <strong>This proof should be stored there over the entire lifecycle of the asset.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Run the ‘register_asset.sh’ script.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if your domain was www.your-example-domain-here.com and the asset id generated was 123abc (it will of course be much longer) then the file generated would be named:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>liquid-asset-proof-123abc
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The domain variable in the code above would be set to:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>your-example-domain-here.com
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So the path used to check asset to domain registry would end up being:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>www.your-example-domain-here.com/.well-known/liquid-asset-proof-123abc
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once that file is accessible you can then run the ‘register_asset.sh’ script and, when the required checks against the domain and issuance transaction have been made, the registration will be found on Blockstream’s <a class="reference external" href="https://assets.blockstream.info">Liquid Asset Registry</a>.</p>

<p>Applications can make use of Liquid’s Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface to develop applications on Linux, Windows and Mac OS in any language capable of handling RPC request-response messaging over HTTP.</p>
<p>Examples are provided in Python, C#, Ruby, Go, Perl, and Java. The Python and C# examples are expanded to cover web applications using Flask and the .NET Core MVC frameworks.</p>
<p>In the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#developer-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Developer Guide</span></a> section, the terminal is used to send commands to the Liquid client (elements-cli), which in turn issues RPC commands to the Liquid daemon (elementsd) or the Liquid Core GUI (elements-qt). This configuration will be familiar to those who develop for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The communication between daemon and client is possible because, when started in server or daemon mode, elementsd initiates an HTTP server and listens for requests being made to it on a port specified in the elements.conf file.</p>
<p>Requests to the daemon are made by posting JSON formatted data to the HTTP server port that elementsd or elements-qt are listening on. The request is processed and the results are returned as JSON formatted data.</p>
<p>Verification details of the credentials needed to make these calls are stored in the elements.config file so the client making the RPC requests can satisfy the authentication checks of the daemon.</p>
<p>Take a look in the elements.conf file and notice the rpc related settings. If there are none then you will have to add some. The “chain” setting tells Liquid to run on the live Liquid network (liquidv1) or another network, such as regtest (elementsregtest). The following settings tell Liquid to start in regtest mode and that it can be accessed over RPC using the username “user1” and the password “password1”. You should change the values used to a secure username and password.</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Start as a background process and accept RPC
daemon=1

# Set RPC details for client authentication
rpcuser=user1
rpcpassword=password1

# Regest settings
chain=elementsregtest
elementsregtest.rpcport=18884
elementsregtest.port=18886
# To connect to other local liduidd instances:
elementsregtest.connect=localhost:18887


# Live network settings:
# chain=liquidv1
# rpcport=18884

# To validate peg-ins
validatepegin=1

# RPC details (as set in bitcoin.conf)
mainchainrpcport=18888
mainchainrpcuser=userOfBitcoinRPCHere
mainchainrpcpassword=passwordOfBitcoinRPCHere

# Other config settings you want to use can go here:
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In our examples, we will be connecting to elementsd in regtest mode, using the regtest authentication details and port number above to send requests to the Liquid daemon. You should change the example code to match what you have set in your own elements.conf.</p>
<p>Please note that the examples listed below are intended to get you to the point where you have a functioning setup which you can use as a building block for further development.</p>

<p>The .NET Core framework runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS. We will use C#, the most popular .NET language, to make a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to the Liquid daemon, which you will need to start using the config file settings <a class="reference internal" href="#config"><span class="std std-ref">outlined above</span></a>.</p>
<p>Our aim is simply to make a call to Liquid using RPC by executing some basic C# code.</p>
<p id="csharp-reqs"><strong>Installing the .NET Core SDK</strong></p>
<p>You can skip this step if you already have the .NET Core SDK installed. The installation instructions are based upon Linux and will vary depending on which OS you are using.</p>
<p>Before installing the .NET Core SDK, you’ll need to register the Microsoft key used to validate the required repository, register the product repository itself, and then install the required dependencies.</p>
<p>Open a command prompt and run the following two commands.</p>
<p>Note that the command you run after “wget” is dependant on the which distribution of Linux you are running. Please check the .NET SDK <a class="reference external" href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/linux-package-manager/rhel/sdk-current">download page</a> to get the right one. There are only two lines below so note the text wrap. The first starts with “wget”, the second with “sudo”.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>wget -q packages-microsoft-prod.deb https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now we can install the .NET Core SDK:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-2.1.4
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Creating the application</strong></p>
<p>Create a simple template console app:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dotnet new console -o liquiddotnet
<span class="nb">cd</span> liquiddotnet
dotnet run
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That will create a file in $HOME/liquiddotnet called Program.cs, execute the code within and output the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Hello World!
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Edit the Program.cs file in $HOME/liquiddotnet using a text editor, change the contents to the following and then save the file: (note that some of the lines below wrap when viewed in a browser)</p>

<p><strong>Running the application</strong></p>
<p>Before you try running any code, make sure the required daemon is running.</p>
<p>Move to the the directory with the file in, compile and run the application:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> liquiddotnet
dotnet run
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Which outputs the results of the getwalletinfo command.</p>
<p>As an application would be making multiple calls to the Liquid daemon via RPC you will probably want to move the code that actually does the request and response work into its own function. An example of how to do this is the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wintercooled/dotnetcoreDynamicJSON-RPC">dynamic JSON RPC class</a>, a C# wrapper class intended to enable simple dynamic JSON RPC calls to Bitcoin, Liquid, Elements and other RPC enabled daemons.</p>
<p>The code above is a starting point to get you up and running and you now have a functioning setup which you can use as a building block for further Liquid development.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">C# .NET Core (MVC)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#c-net-core-mvc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The .NET Core framework runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS. We will use C#, the most popular .NET language, within an MVC web application to make a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to the Liquid daemon, which you will need to start using the config file settings <a class="reference internal" href="#config"><span class="std std-ref">outlined above</span></a>.</p>
<p>Our aim is simply to make a call to Liquid using RPC by executing some basic C# code.</p>
<p><strong>Installing the .NET Core SDK</strong></p>
<p>Before starting, check that you have installed the required <a class="reference internal" href="#csharp-reqs"><span class="std std-ref">prerequisites</span></a> from the previous example.</p>
<p><strong>Creating the application</strong></p>
<p>We will be using the Model, View, Controller (MVC) pattern for our app. We will also be using an existing class to handle the calls to Liquid daemon and simplify our code. We will amend the default Home controller to call this class and pass the data it returns back to the relevant View using a new Model that we’ll also create.</p>
<p>To get started, create a directory for our MVC app and move into it:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mkdir LiquidMVC
<span class="nb">cd</span> LiquidMVC
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Use the dotnet tool to create a new template mvc site. This will set up the required folder structure, files, and configuration needed to serve the web app:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dotnet new mvc
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Check it is set up correctly by running the app:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dotnet run
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When it says the application has started, browse to <a class="reference external" href="https://localhost:5001">https://localhost:5001</a></p>
<p>You should see the template site running, all we have to do is add our own code to what’s already there.</p>
<p>Shut the app down using Ctrl+C.</p>
<p>Now we will start adding our own code so that we can query our Liquid node and display the results on the app’s home page.</p>
<p>Create a new file named “dotnetcoreDynamicJSON-RPC.cs” in the LiquidMVC directory and paste in the <a class="reference external" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wintercooled/dotnetcoreDynamicJSON-RPC/master/dotnetcoreDynamicJSON-RPC.cs">raw code</a> of the “Dynamic JSON RPC class” and save it. Alternatively, clone the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wintercooled/dotnetcoreDynamicJSON-RPC">GitHub repository</a> into a different directory and copy the dotnetcoreDynamicJSON-RPC.cs file into your LiquidMVC directory.</p>
<p>This class is a C# wrapper class intended to enable simple dynamic JSON RPC calls to Bitcoin, Liquid, Elements, and other RPC enabled daemons. The project, along with examples of how to use it, can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wintercooled/dotnetcoreDynamicJSON-RPC">repository</a>. All we need for now though is to copy the code from the raw link</p>
<p>That class enables us to easily query our node. We’ll add the code to call it soon, first we need a way to pass the data that we get back from our node to the web page for display. For that we need a Model. We’ll create a simple one that you can add to later.</p>
<p>Create a new file named “ExampleNodeInfo.cs” in LiquidMVC/Models and paste the following into it:</p>
<div class="highlight-C# notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">using</span> <span class="nn">System</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now we have a way to get data from our node and a Model that lets us pass the data to the View for display.</p>
<p>Open the HomeController.cs file in LiquidMVC/Controllers. We will be adding code to call the Dynamic JSON RPC class to get data from our Liquid node, populate our Model with the results and hand the Model to the landing page’s View for display.</p>
<p>To the top of the HomeController.cs file, add the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-C# notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">using</span> <span class="nn">DotnetcoreDynamicJSONRPC</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then replace the Index method so it looks like the following. Note that some of the lines below wrap when viewed in a browser.</p>
<div class="highlight-C# notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">IActionResult</span> <span class="nf">Index</span><span class="p">()</span>

</div>
<p><strong>Running the application</strong></p>
<p>Before you try running the code, make sure the Liquid daemon is running. Make sure your terminal is at the LiquidMVC directory level and run the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dotnet run
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When it says the application has started, browse to <a class="reference external" href="https://localhost:5001">https://localhost:5001</a></p>
<p>The balance of the Liquid node’s wallet is displayed on the page.</p>
<p>That should have got you up and running and in order to extend your application, you can look at the examples on the Dynamic JSON RPC class GitHub <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wintercooled/dotnetcoreDynamicJSON-RPC">site</a>.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Perl</a><a class="headerlink" href="#perl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this example we will be using Perl to make a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to the Liquid daemon, which you will need to start using the config file settings <a class="reference internal" href="#config"><span class="std std-ref">outlined above</span></a>.</p>
<p>Our aim is simply to make a call to Liquid using RPC by executing some basic Perl code.</p>
<p>Perl can be installed from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.perl.org">https://www.perl.org</a> and comes pre-installed on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>We will be using the <a class="reference external" href="https://metacpan.org/pod/release/MAKAMAKA/JSON-RPC-0.95/lib/JSON/RPC/Client.pm">JSON::RPC::Client</a> Perl implementation of a JSON-RPC client which will make the rpc calls and results handling simpler.</p>
<p>To install JSON::RPC::Client open the CPAN tool from the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>perl -MCPAN -e shell
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And from within the cpan console, install the RPC Client:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>install JSON::RPC::Client
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And then exit the cpan tool:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>quit
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You must close the terminal window so that when we run the code below it will pick up the new environment variables written.</p>

<p>As Liquid is built on top of the Bitcoin codebase, the format of the transaction is similiar in many ways, but it does contain some extra sections and slight differences in the way some data is returned.</p>
<p>The examples below show a transaction within the calling node’s wallet (using gettransaction) and a transaction that is not in the node’s wallet (using decoderawtransaction). Peg-out transaction properties are show later for reference.</p>

<h3>Using Liquid Swap Tool<a class="headerlink" href="#using-liquid-swap-tool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Liquid Swap Tool can generate, check and sign Liquid asset swap data. The data it generates during the swap process must be exchanged between the two parties outside of the tool itself. The swap data is just plain text and can be copied and pasted into whatever communication method the two parties choose to use.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll refer to the person who initiates the swap as the Proposer, and the party on the other side of the swap as the Respondent. We’ll be swapping some <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L-BTC</span></code> for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">USDt</span></code>.</p>
<p>The Proposer starts the swap by clicking <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Start</span> <span class="pre">New</span> <span class="pre">Swap</span></code>.</p>
<img alt="_images/swap01.png" class="align-center" src="_images/swap01.png" />
<p>The Proposer then selects the asset and the amount of the asset they will send, the asset and amount of that asset that they would like to receive in return.</p>
<img alt="_images/swap02.png" class="align-center" src="_images/swap02.png" />
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The drop down list of assets that can be sent is populated with assets that are currently held in your local Liquid node’s wallet. Either the asset id or the asset label is displayed, depending on if a label has been set. You can set the label by assigning it against the hex identifier of the asset. This can be done in the relevant elements.conf file by adding a line for each asset you want to label using the format <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">assetdir=asset_hex_here:your_label_here</span></code></p>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L-BTC</span></code> label is mapped by default to the L-BTC asset.</p>
<p>The receive asset drop down also contains assets currently held in your local wallet. You can add a new asset (for example, one that you have yet to receive) by pasting in the asset id from the person who wants to send it to you. You can cross-reference the asset id against <a class="reference external" href="https://assets.blockstream.info/">Blockstream’s Liquid Asset Registry</a> if the asset has been registered by the original issuer.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Add</span> <span class="pre">New</span> <span class="pre">Asset</span></code> button can be used to map an asset id that you do not yet have in your wallet to a label. This makes it easier to perform swaps without having to remember the id of individual assets each time. The example below shows how to map an asset with the id <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">946cfcc80...</span></code> to a local label of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">YourLocalAssetLabel</span></code>. Please be aware that the labels you create are not shared with others on the Liquid network, who will see either the asset id, or their own locally assigned asset label during the swap.</p>

<p>When the assets and amount have been entered, the Proposer then clicks the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Generate</span> <span class="pre">Proposal</span></code> button.</p>
<p>The Proposer copies the generated proposal and sends it to the Respondent.</p>
<p>The Respondent will start their side of the swap by clicking <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Continue</span> <span class="pre">Swap</span></code> within their Liquid Swap Tool, and pasting in the text the Proposer sent them.</p>
<p>The Respondent can then view the details of the proposed swap. If they decide to accept the proposal, they click <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Accept</span> <span class="pre">Proposal</span></code>, which gives them the chance to review the fees that will be paid, along with the address that they will receive funds to.</p>
<img alt="_images/swap03.png" class="align-center" src="_images/swap03.png" />
<p>If the Respondent accepts the swap, they are presented with the signed acceptance data, which they have to send back to the Proposer. At this stage, the swap is not yet complete.</p>
<p>If the Proposer wants to complete the swap, they click <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Continue</span> <span class="pre">Swap</span></code> from the Liquid Swap Tool’s welcome screen, paste in the text the Respondent sent them, and verify the contents of the trade. If the Proposer accepts the swap, they click <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Execute</span> <span class="pre">Swap</span></code>, before finally confirming that they are willing to pay the fees needed for their part of the swap.</p>
<p>The Liquid Swap Tool signs and broadcasts the transaction, completing the swap for both parties.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-liquid">
<h3>What is Liquid?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-liquid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Liquid is an implementation of a federated sidechain - a blockchain with different features, capabilities, and benefits than the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>The Liquid Network was built to address the particular needs of traders who use exchanges. It enables the rapid, confidential, and secure transfer of funds between participants, providing a solution to the inherent problem of delayed transaction finality on the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>Liquid’s sidechain is built on the Elements codebase and uses Blockstream’s Strong Federation technology to support the 1-to-1 exchange of bitcoin between chains.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-the-benefits-of-liquid">
<h3>What are the benefits of Liquid?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-liquid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Faster Trading - Near instant bitcoin transfers between exchanges allow users to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities like never before.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced Efficiency - Market makers can improve their capital efficiency by reducing balances held across multiple exchanges.</p></li>
<li><p>Better Privacy - Liquid supports Confidential Transactions for bitcoin amounts as they are transferred between users in the system, which protects users from exposure.</p></li>
<li><p>Superb Reliability - Built using the battle-tested Bitcoin codebase, Liquid software is highly reliable. Also, since Liquid uses signed blocks instead of mining, blocks are targeted to be one minute apart instead of the more variable ten minute blocks in Bitcoin.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="who-are-the-members-of-liquid">
<h3>Who are the members of Liquid?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-are-the-members-of-liquid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Liquid Network is comprised of a group of exchanges, traders, and financial institutions from nine countries across four continents. Currently, Liquid members include: Altonomy, Bitbank, Bitfinex, Bitmax, BitMEX, Bitso, BTCBOX, BTCTrader/BtcTurk, BTSE, Cobo, Coinone, Coinut, Crypto Garage, DGroup, DMM Japan, FRNT Financial, Gate.io, GOPAX (operated by Streami), Huobi, L2B Global, OKCoin, OpenNode, Poolin, Prycto, Sideshift AI, The Rock Trading, SIX Digital Exchange, TaoTao, Tilde, Unocoin, Xapo, XBTO, and Zaif.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-end-users-traders-benefit-from-liquid">
<h3>How do end users/traders benefit from Liquid?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-end-users-traders-benefit-from-liquid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Users and members can benefit from Liquid through the ability to send bitcoins between member exchanges, who can send Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC: BTC pegged into the Liquid sidechain) on their behalf. End-users can also withdraw L-BTC from exchanges to wallets that support Liquid, such as Blockstream Green or withdraw from one exchange directly onto their Liquid deposit address at another Liquid member exchange. Other wallets plan to support Liquid in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-exchanges-use-liquid-to-help-traders-move-funds-more-quickly">
<h3>How do exchanges use Liquid to help traders move funds more quickly?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-exchanges-use-liquid-to-help-traders-move-funds-more-quickly" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Exchanges may maintain a balance of L-BTC to do fast conversion from user deposits in BTC so users can immediately trade across exchanges using Liquid. For L-BTC deposits exchanges can receive deposits and credit their customers accounts within minutes, rather than waiting for unpredictable Bitcoin blocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-can-traders-use-liquid-to-reduce-custodial-risk">
<h3>How can traders use Liquid to reduce custodial risk?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-can-traders-use-liquid-to-reduce-custodial-risk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Traders often need to leave funds on an exchange for an extended period of time to avoid missing favorable trading opportunities. Liquid allows traders to move L-BTC into their own wallet while still being able to quickly move them back to an exchange in two minutes. This allows traders to use a multi-signature trust model to hold their assets rather than relying on a single exchange.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-issued-assets">
<h3>What are Issued Assets?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-issued-assets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Liquid was built using the Elements blockchain platform and therefore has multi-asset issuance capabilities built in through the Confidential Assets feature. This allows anyone to create new assets for many purposes such as stablecoins, security tokens, utility tokens, and digital collectibles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-confidential-transactions">
<h3>What are Confidential Transactions?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-confidential-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Liquid is designed to be auditable and open to any network participant, as well as to facilitate confidentiality between transacting parties. Like Bitcoin, Liquid transactions are viewable by everyone in the network, though Confidential Transactions hide transaction amounts from everyone except for the parties directly involved in the transaction itself. In doing so, it minimizes front-running risks that occur through blockchain analysis.</p>
<p>Confidential Transactions fundamentally provide privacy for any end user that requires it, regardless of reason. Use cases for this level of commercial transaction privacy will become more apparent as the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem matures, and larger market makers and financial institutions begin trading bitcoin across exchanges. They will want to move bitcoin between their accounts at different exchanges, without broadcasting the amounts to the general public, providing assurances that their trading strategies and holdings are not exploited by potential competitors.</p>
<p>Private solvency proofs are also possible using Confidential Transactions to remove the need to show the full amount held but instead show that a threshold is met in order to prove reserves are adequate. For example: user account balances can be shown to sum to the total assets held without revealing individual amounts or even what that sum is. The number of transaction participants is even hidden.</p>
<p>Liquid makes compliance easy, whilst providing privacy of transactions. This would be impossible without the use of Confidential Transactions.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-is-liquid-a-federated-sidechain">
<h3>Why is Liquid a federated sidechain?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-liquid-a-federated-sidechain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Bitcoin blockchain excels at offering the permissionless, trustless, and censorship-resistant transfer of value. However, achieving those ends comes at the expense of a deterministic transaction flow and with the expense of mining. The Liquid sidechain provides a different set of trade-offs that allow privacy and rapid finality of asset transfer at the expense of being a permissioned network relying on trust of the functionaries.</p>
<p>Extending the Bitcoin protocol using a sidechain allows the main chain to remain secure, specialized and robust whilst its underlying properties support the smooth operation of the sidechain.</p>
<p>Whereas Bitcoin is secured by proof of work, assets on the Liquid blockchain are secured by a Strong Federation of trusted functionaries. This allows transactions on Liquid to reach a state of finality faster and more reliably than those on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-does-btc-become-l-btc-and-vice-versa">
<h3>How does BTC become L-BTC and vice versa?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-btc-become-l-btc-and-vice-versa" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Users of Liquid are able to send bitcoins to an address controlled by the Liquid Federation; these users will be credited with L-BTC once the mainchain transaction receives 102 confirmations. This process is known as a peg-in. A high threshold of confirmations is needed to ensure that the network stays solvent in case of mainchain reorganizations. Members of Liquid should maintain a portion of their funds as L-BTC based on user demand for L-BTC and can rebalance as needed. If a user wishes to move L-BTC back to BTC, they can make a peg-out transaction in Liquid that will instruct the functionaries to pay to their mainchain address. Only members of the Liquid network are able to peg-out L-BTC.</p>

<div class="section" id="can-i-run-a-liquid-full-node">
<h3>Can I run a Liquid full node?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-run-a-liquid-full-node" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Yes. Anyone can run a full node for Liquid. Download the node software here.</p>

<h3>What happens to the bitcoin held by the federation if Liquid stops functioning?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-happens-to-the-bitcoin-held-by-the-federation-if-liquid-stops-functioning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are emergency keys that are able to access the bitcoin held by the network only if the network is down for an extended period of time. The keys are strictly powerless otherwise. All efforts will be made to revive the network before using these emergency keys. These keys will allow the bitcoin held by the Liquid Network to be returned to the last owner on the Liquid blockchain. Issued Assets can be migrated to another platform, or a new blockchain compatible with Liquid, depending on the preferences of the issuer of the asset.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-the-difference-between-lightning-and-liquid">
<h3>What’s the difference between Lightning and Liquid?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-the-difference-between-lightning-and-liquid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Lightning requires routes between the parties of a transaction to exist before the transaction. This makes Lightning very well suited for micropayments. However, this approach present challenges for larger payments that may be made between arbitrary parties, as a route might not always be available. Liquid allows parties to send funds of any size at any time. Liquid also supports multiple assets, which can make it useful for single-transaction atomic swaps that require no setup. Blockstream is a strong believer in both Liquid and Lightning, but for different use cases.</p>
<p>Due to being based on Bitcoin, Liquid already supports Lightning transactions with L-BTC, allowing even faster transfers and smaller-value payments. Lightning support for Issued Assets will also be coming in the future.</p>

<div class="section" id="who-can-join-liquid">
<h3>Who can join Liquid?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-can-join-liquid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Liquid membership is intended for cryptocurrency exchanges, OTC desks, large traders, and financial institutions. Smaller traders and individual users will still be able to use Liquid through member exchanges, running a Liquid full node, or Liquid-enabled wallets such as Blockstream Green.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-controls-liquid">
<h3>Who controls Liquid?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-controls-liquid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Liquid is operated by its members. Blockstream has no control over the network and only serves as a technology provider to the network members. Liquid can continue indefinitely even if Blockstream ceased to exist or if the members no longer wanted to receive support from Blockstream.</p>
